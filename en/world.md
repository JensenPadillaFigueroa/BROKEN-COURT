## LOCATIONS

### Yadi's Island — "Isla Brava"

- Small tropical Caribbean island, humid — inspired by Puerto Rico
- Colorful but humble streets, houses faded by sun and sea salt, palm trees, wild vegetation, the smell of the ocean always present
- Reggaetón and salsa playing from windows, neighbors shouting between balconies, stray dogs, fried food on the corner
- A single public tennis court — cracked, invaded by tropical weeds, net in disrepair, lines faded
- The court is next to an old school, near the beach
- Don Emilio maintains it as best he can — cuts the weeds growing through the cracks with a machete
- **Local legend**: The only great player who ever came out of Isla Brava was **Luna Borín** — she won the Olympic gold medal in tennis 10 years ago. She's the island's heroine. There's a mural of her on the wall of the court where Yadi practices. She proved it's possible to make it out. Yadi grew up seeing her as proof that the dream is possible.
- **Visual significance**: Vibrant tropical colors — turquoise, jungle green, sunset orange, ocean blue — panels with wide open sky and ocean in the background, palm trees on every horizon. Visible heat in the air. Freedom but also isolation — it's an island, the world is far away

### City Public Courts — "Municipal Sports Center"

- Where Yadi meets Yen
- 4 cement courts, better maintained than the island's
- Surrounded by grey buildings — contrast with the tropical island
- Where Yadi trains with Yen for weeks

### National Junior Club — "Youth Arena"

- Where the National Junior Tournament is held
- 8 hard courts, central court with 2,000 seat capacity
- Modern locker rooms, gym, physiotherapy area
- **Visual contrast**: Everything clean, bright, perfect — Yadi feels out of place
- Rich players look at him like an intruder

### National League Complex — "Corona Stadium"

- Where Yadi plays his first professional match
- Center court with 10,000 seat capacity
- Where world stars play when visiting the country
- **Visual significance**: Enormous panels, splash pages, the court feels like a coliseum. Yadi feels tiny walking in.

### Legend Locations (appear briefly in Ch 8-9)

| Legend | Location | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Novacronos | "Tower of Time" — His private academy in Europe | Elegant office overlooking perfect grass courts, antique clock on the wall |
| Rafa Nal | "Bull Fortress" — Training center in his country | Clay courts surrounded by mountains, rustic but functional facilities |
| Noak | Locker room after a match | Minimalist, tidy, a bottle of water and a towel. Nothing more. |

## TENNIS CULTURE IN THIS WORLD

### The Eras

1. **The Great 3 Era** (5-20 years ago): Novacronos, Rafa Nal, and Noak dominated tennis for two decades. They're considered the three greatest of all time. Their rivalry defined the sport.

2. **The Transition Era** (last 3-5 years): Novacronos and Rafa Nal retired. Noak endures. The new generation emerges.

3. **The New Kings Era** (present): Charlie and Jani lead. They're considered the heirs. But they haven't yet reached the legend status of the Great 3.

4. **The Diamond Era** (future — Vol. 2+): Will Yadi be the one to break all the molds?

### Special Shots (Manga Style)

In this world, elite players have shots that transcend the normal. They're not literally "magical," but they're represented with exaggerated manga-style visual effects:

| Player | Special Shot | Visual Effect |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Novacronos** | "Chronos Slice" — Backhand slice that seems to freeze time | Ball glows golden, leaves a clock trail |
| **Rafa Nal** | "Toro Spin" — Topspin with monstrous power | Ball leaves a fire trail, ground shakes on the bounce |
| **Noak** | "Infinite Return" — Returns any ball, no matter what | Transparent shield aura, the ball always comes back |
| **Jani** | "Glacial Ray" — Forehand with laser speed and precision | Ice-blue ray, freezes the line where it lands |
| **Charlie** | "Total Impact" — Can replicate any shot he's seen | Multicolor aura, changes based on the shot he replicates |
| **Yadi** | "Diamond Vision" — Sees the game in slow motion | Glowing eyes, trajectory lines visible, world goes dark except the ball and the angles |

## NARRATIVE RULES OF THE WORLD

1. **No real magic** — The "powers" are visual representations of extreme talent. In-universe, they're natural abilities pushed to the human limit.

2. **Tennis is religion** — In this world, tennis has massive cultural importance. Great players are treated as heroes/gods.

3. **Money matters** — Access to professional tennis requires resources. This is a real barrier Yadi faces. It's not ignored or minimized.

4. **Injuries are real** — Unlike other sports manga, injuries here have lasting consequences (Yen's knee, for example).

5. **Respect is earned on the court** — It doesn't matter who you are outside. Inside the court, only how you play matters.
