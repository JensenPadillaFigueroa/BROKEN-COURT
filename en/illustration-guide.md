# PART 1: CHARACTER DESIGNS (Character Sheets)

## VISUAL CONCEPT: HYBRIDS vs AURAS

**FUNDAMENTAL RULE**: Only the **Great 3** (Novacronos, Rafa Nal, Noak) are **LITERAL HYBRIDS** — they have animal heads on human bodies. They are the only figures that visually transcend humanity. They are GODS of tennis. Their design reflects that.

**All other characters are 100% HUMAN.** Their animal association is expressed ONLY as:
- Background shadows/silhouettes during intense moments
- Translucent energy auras
- Subtle visual metaphors (posture, movement, eyes)
- NEVER physical animal features on their body

| Type | Characters | How it looks |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **LITERAL HYBRID** (animal head) | Novacronos (eagle), Rafa Nal (bull), Noak (goat) | Real animal head on athletic human body. Always. They don't transform — they ARE this way. |
| **HUMAN + AURA** (visual metaphor only) | Yadi, Yen, Charlie, Jani, Daimon, Kai, Luca, Luna Borín, etc. | Normal people. At key moments, an animal shadow/aura appears BEHIND or AROUND them, never ON them. |

# PART 5: TECHNICAL NOTES FOR AI GENERATION

## Tips for best results:

1. **Character consistency**: Generate the character sheet FIRST and use it as a reference (img2img or reference image) for all subsequent scenes
2. **The 3 Literal Hybrids (Great 3)**: For Novacronos, Rafa Nal, and Noak use `anthropomorphic [eagle/bull/goat] head on human body`. These ALWAYS have animal heads. In EVERY scene where they appear.
3. **ALL others are HUMAN**: Use `fully human, no animal features` in prompts. The animal appears ONLY as `translucent [animal] shadow/aura behind the character, separate from body`. NEVER animal features on the character.
4. **Tropical setting**: For Isla Brava scenes use `Caribbean tropical island, palm trees, turquoise ocean, colorful faded houses, tropical vegetation, humid heat`
5. **Luna Borín's mural**: Include `faded mural of woman holding Olympic gold medal on concrete wall` in every scene set at the island court
6. **Suggested negative prompts**: `bad anatomy, deformed hands, extra fingers, blurry, low quality, chibi, super deformed, western cartoon style` + for human characters add: `animal ears, animal features, furry, anthro`
7. **Recommended models**: Anything V5, Counterfeit V3, MeinaMix for anime/manga style
8. **Resolution**: Minimum 2048x2048 for splash pages, 1024x1024 for individual panels

## Generation priority order:

1. ⭐ Character sheets for the Great 3 (literal hybrids — eagle, bull, goat)
2. ⭐ Yadi character sheet (human)
3. ⭐ Volume 1 Cover (Scene 1)
