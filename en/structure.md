**Goal**: Introduce Yadi, his world, and plant the seed of his supernatural talent.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-2 | **Opening splash page** | Aerial view of Isla Brava — Caribbean tropical island, palm trees, colorful houses faded by sun and salt, turquoise ocean in the background. A broken tennis court invaded by tropical weeds in the center. A faded mural of Luna Borín (the local heroine, Olympic gold) on the wall. A boy alone, hitting against that wall. Narration: *"In a world where giants rule the court... sometimes thunder is born from silence."* |
| 3-4 | **Yadi practicing** | Yadi hits old balls against the wall. His movements are rough but there are flashes of something extraordinary. Don Emilio watches from a bench, smoking. |
| 5-6 | **Quick flashback** | 8-year-old Yadi watching on an old TV the final between Novacronos and Rafa Nal. His eyes glow. His father, serious but with a proud smile, places the bandana on his head: *"Tennis is the only sport where you play alone against the world, son. So be a tiger."* His mother beside them, nervous even watching TV: *"Oh god, these matches are going to kill me!"* |
| 7-8 | **The Rodríguez family** | Yadi comes home. Humble dinner but full of life. Papa Rodríguez, serious and competitive, asks about every detail of his training: *"How was your backhand today? Better than yesterday?"* Mama Rodríguez notices his blistered hands and puts ice on them with a worried face while cracking a joke: *"If you keep this up you're going to have lizard hands."* Both work hard so Yadi can keep playing. Family love moment. |
| 9-11 | **Public courts — Meeting Yen** | Next day. Yadi arrives early at the public courts in the nearby city. A young man (Yen, 23) is practicing alone. They exchange glances. Yen challenges him casually: *"You playing or just watching?"* |
| 12-14 | **The revealing match** | Yadi vs Yen. Yen dominates easily at first, but suddenly Yadi hits an impossible shot — a passing shot at an angle that shouldn't exist. His eyes glow for an instant (first power activation). Yen freezes. Panel of Yen's eyes widening. |
| 15 | **Closing** | Yen, towel on his shoulder, watching Yadi pick up balls without realizing what he just did. Yen thinks: *"What was that...?"* |

---

### Chapter 2: "The Truth That Hurts" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: Establish the mentor-student relationship between Yen and Yadi. Show Yadi's weaknesses.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-3 | **Yen seeks Yadi** | Yen returns to the court the next day. Finds him. Proposes training together. Yadi is suspicious but accepts. First training: Yen systematically destroys him. |
| 4-6 | **The first truth** | After training. Yadi frustrated, nearly crying. Yen sits beside him: *"You have something I never had. But right now you're a bomb without a detonator. All that talent... and your head sabotages you every 5 minutes."* Yadi gets angry. Yen doesn't flinch. |
| 7-9 | **Training montage** | Weeks pass. Double-page montage: Yen making Yadi play blindfolded, meditate before matches, play with music blasting to learn to focus in chaos. Yen being brutally honest: *"You're worrying again. See that ball? That ball doesn't know you're poor. Doesn't know you're scared. It only knows where you send it."* |
| 10-12 | **Visible progress** | Yadi starts to change. Plays looser. Smiles on court. The flashes of his power appear more often. Yen notices but says nothing. Panel of Yen smiling subtly with his back turned. |
| 13-14 | **Yadi surpasses Yen** | A practice match where Yadi wins for the first time. Doesn't celebrate excessively — looks at Yen with respect. Yen nods: *"About time, idiot."* Moment of camaraderie. |
| 15 | **Revelation** | Yen shows him a flyer: the National Junior Tournament. *"It's time for the world to see what I saw."* Yadi looks at the flyer. His hands tremble. |

### Chapter 3: "The World Out There" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: Yadi leaves the island. Culture shock. Introduce the junior circuit and rivals.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-2 | **Farewell** | Mama Rodríguez hands him a used racket wrapped in paper, eyes teary but smiling: *"If you break it, I'll break you."* Papa Rodríguez, serious, puts his hand on his shoulder: *"Go and be a tiger. Don't be afraid of anyone."* Mama already crying. Papa too, but hiding it. Don Emilio at the court gate: *"Go, kid. This court is too small for you now."* |
| 3-5 | **Arriving at the tournament** | Yadi and Yen arrive at the club hosting the tournament. Everything is different: perfect courts, players with full teams, coaches, physiotherapists, brand-name clothes. Yadi with his used racket and old clothes. The stares judge him. |
| 6-8 | **Rival introductions** | Manga-style introduction panel: Daimon Richwell arrives in a luxury car, full entourage. *"#1 Junior Ranking"*. Kai Morimoto sitting alone in a corner, stoic. Luca Santori smiling while watching everyone. Yadi is invisible to them. |
| 9-11 | **The provocation** | Daimon sees Yadi in the locker room. Notices his clothes and racket. *"You? With that racket? This isn't charity, it's professional tennis."* Laughter from his group. Yadi doesn't respond, but clenches his fists. Yen, from behind: *"Save that rage. You'll need it on the court."* |
| 12-14 | **Draw reveal** | The tournament bracket is revealed. Yadi is in the bottom half. If he advances, he'll face Daimon in the quarterfinals. Panel of all rivals' faces on the bracket, like a war map. |
| 15 | **Epic closing** | Yadi on the empty court at night, practicing alone under the lights. Close-up of his eyes — pure determination. *"I didn't come here to participate. I came here to make them know who I am."* |

## ACT 2: THE FIRE (Chapters 4–7) — ~60 pages

### Chapter 4: "First Blood" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: Yadi's first official match. Show his nervousness and real-time evolution.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-2 | **Before the match** | Yadi in the locker room, nervous. Remembers Yen's words: *"Don't think about winning. Think about each ball. One at a time."* Puts on his father's bandana. |
| 3-5 | **First set — Disaster** | Yadi against a decent rival (#15 ranking). Loses the first set 6-2. He's tense, missing easy shots. The crowd murmurs. Daimon watches with contempt from the stands. |
| 6-8 | **The mental break** | At the changeover, Yadi closes his eyes. Flashback to Yen: *"When everything goes against you, let go. Stop fighting yourself. Play."* Yadi opens his eyes. Something changes. His posture relaxes. He smiles for the first time in the match. |
| 9-13 | **The transformation** | Second set: Yadi plays completely different. Loose, aggressive, reading the game. His eyes flash briefly (partial power activation). Impossible shots, absurd angles. The rival doesn't understand what happened. Wins the second set 6-1. Third set: total domination. 6-3. Victory. |
| 14-15 | **Reactions** | The crowd murmurs. Daimon frowns for the first time. Kai observes with interest. Yen in the stands, arms crossed, nodding imperceptibly. Yadi looks at his hands as if he can't believe what he just did. |

---

### Chapter 5: "The Wall" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: Yadi faces Kai Morimoto. Learns that talent alone isn't enough.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-3 | **Pre-match** | Yen warns Yadi: *"This kid doesn't have your talent. But he has something worse: infinite patience. If you play his game, you lose."* Yadi is overconfident after his first victory. |
| 4-8 | **The match — The wall** | Yadi attacks with everything. Powerful shots, perfect angles. Kai... returns everything. Everything. No emotion. No tiring. Yadi gets frustrated. Starts forcing shots. Errors. Loses the first set 7-5. Repetitive panels showing Kai returning every ball like a robot. |
| 9-11 | **The lesson** | Changeover. Yadi looks at Yen desperately. Yen shouts from the stands: *"Stop fighting him! Fight yourself!"* Yadi understands: he needs a plan, not just talent. Starts thinking strategically for the first time. |
| 12-14 | **Smart comeback** | Yadi changes strategy. Mixes rhythms, comes to the net (something he never does), varies his shots. Kai shows a crack in his armor for the first time. Yadi wins the second and third sets. Difficult, hard-fought victory, but formative. |
| 15 | **Respect** | Kai shakes his hand at the net. First rival to look him in the eye with respect: *"We'll play again."* |

### Chapter 6: "Venom" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: Yadi faces Luca Santori. Learns about malice and mind games.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-3 | **Pre-match — The trap** | Luca approaches Yadi before the match, friendly: *"Great game yesterday, huh? Hey, they say Daimon is waiting for you in the final. Aren't you scared?"* Plants seeds of doubt with smiles. Yen warns: *"That guy is a viper. Don't give him anything."* |
| 4-7 | **First set — Psychological domination** | Luca uses every trick: excessive time-wasting, condescending gestures, exaggerated celebration of every point. Yadi falls for it. Loses focus, gets angry. Loses the first set 6-4. |
| 8-10 | **The collapse** | Yadi is on the edge. At the changeover, Yen tells him calmly: *"He's playing with you, not against you. You decide if you give him power over your head. Who controls your mind? You or him?"* |
| 11-13 | **Birth of the armor** | Yadi closes his eyes. Manga visualization: an invisible armor forms around him. When he opens his eyes, he no longer reacts to anything from Luca. Every provocation bounces off. Yadi plays cold, lethal, emotionless. Luca panics because he's lost his weapon. Yadi wins the second set 6-2. |
| 14 | **The final blow** | Third set, match point. Yadi looks Luca in the eye — not with hate, but with nothing. Ace down the center. Victory. Luca smashes his racket furiously. |
| 15 | **Evolution** | Yen smiles genuinely for the first time: *"Now yes... now you're ready."* Yadi touches his chest — feels the armor still there. He's created his mental shield. |

### Chapter 7: "The Golden Boy vs. The Island Diamond" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: THE SPORTS CLIMAX. Yadi vs Daimon. The battle that changes everything.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-2 | **The antechamber** | Double page: center court packed. Electric atmosphere. Split panel: Yadi on one side of the tunnel with his used racket and bandana; Daimon on the other with his elite gear. Narration: *"Money vs. hunger. Privilege vs. will."* |
| 3-4 | **First game** | Daimon serves first. Devastating serve. Ace, ace, winner, ace. 1-0. Yadi didn't touch the ball. Crowd applauds. Daimon smiles arrogantly. Yen thinks: *"Easy. Let him throw everything he's got."* |
| 5-7 | **First set — Balance** | Even match. Both are good. Daimon has better base technique (more formal training). Yadi has instinct. They break each other's serve. Tie-break. Daimon wins 7-6(5). Celebrates excessively looking at Yadi. |
| 8-9 | **The moment of truth** | Changeover. Yadi is calm — the mental armor is active. Remembers all the insults, the stares, the old racket, dinners with his parents, their sacrifice. Not with rage... with purpose. *"I don't have what they have... but I have something money can't buy."* |
| 10-12 | **Full activation** | Second set. Yadi enters "the zone" for the first time completely. EPIC DOUBLE PAGE: his eyes fully illuminate. Time slows down for him. He sees ball trajectories as lines of light. Every shot is perfect. Every move anticipated. Daimon can't do anything. 6-1. Spectators on their feet. Whispers: *"Who is this kid...?"* |
| 13-14 | **Third set — Destruction** | Yadi is no longer the insecure kid from the island. He's a machine. Daimon crumbles mentally — for the first time in his life, money can't save him. 6-2. Match point: Yadi hits a winner that passes centimeters from the line. IN. Victory. |
| 15 | **Silence then thunder** | One second of absolute silence. Then the court explodes. Yadi falls to his knees, looks at the sky, tears. Yen in the stands, crying silently with a smile. Daimon in his chair, shattered, staring at his thousand-dollar racket that wasn't enough. **Final splash panel**: someone in the shadows watching from a VIP box, phone in hand. Can't see who. Only their silhouette and a smile. |

## ACT 3: THE HORIZON (Chapters 8–10) — ~45 pages

### Chapter 8: "What Comes Next" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: Consequences of the victory. Yadi starts getting noticed. The world opens up.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-3 | **After the match** | Yadi and Yen celebrate modestly. Call home — Mama Rodríguez cries and screams: *"I knew it! But are you okay?! Did you get hurt?!"* Papa Rodríguez takes the phone, serious: *"Good match. Now the next one."* but his voice cracks with pride. Don Emilio on the island sees the result in an old newspaper and smiles big. |
| 4-6 | **The circuit takes notice** | Reaction montage: sports articles mentioning Yadi, commentators talking about the "unknown kid who destroyed the #1 junior." Social media explodes with clips of his best shots. |
| 7-9 | **Semi-final** | Quick match (not detailed) — Yadi wins with confidence but without arrogance. Tournament advances. |
| 10-12 | **The final** | Yadi wins the national junior tournament final. Ceremony. Raises the trophy. But what matters most is Yen's look from the stands — a nod worth more than any trophy. |
| 13-15 | **The echo reaches the top** | Sequence of panels with no dialogue: in different parts of the world, the legends find out. Roger Novacronos in his elegant office, reads something on his tablet, raises an eyebrow. Rafa Nal in his training center, someone shows him a video on a phone, his eyes widen. Noak after a veterans' match, his assistant shows him statistics, Noak smiles enigmatically. Final panel: a hand picking up a phone. Dialing a number. |

### Chapter 9: "The Eyes of the World" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: Yadi enters the national league. First visual contact with the stars. The dream becomes real.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-3 | **National league invitation** | Yadi receives a wild card for a national league tournament (adults). Yen announces it: *"It's another level. These aren't rich kids playing. These are professionals. Are you ready?"* Yadi: *"No. But I'm going anyway."* |
| 4-6 | **Arriving at the national tournament** | Everything is bigger, faster, more intense. Yadi on the practice court. Sees players he only knew from television. Feels small for the first time in a long while. |
| 7-9 | **The encounter** | Yadi is practicing when, on the adjacent court, **Charlie** appears — the #1 in the world, training before his match. Double page: Charlie hitting the ball with a power and precision Yadi has never seen in person. The ball leaves a visual speed trail. Yadi freezes watching. Charlie notices, smiles, and gives him a gesture with his racket — a casual greeting that for Yadi is an earthquake. |
| 10-12 | **Jani** | At another moment, Yadi sees **Jani** enter the complex. Cold, elegant, looking at no one. An aura of royalty. Yadi thinks: *"It's like watching Novacronos in the videos... but young."* Jani walks past without looking at him. A chill runs through Yadi. |
| 13-14 | **The reflection** | Night. Yadi alone in his hotel room (the cheapest in the complex). Looks at his father's bandana. *"Dad... I'm here. I'm where I always dreamed. And it's bigger than I imagined."* |
| 15 | **Renewed determination** | Yadi stands up. Looks at himself in the mirror. Puts on the bandana. *"Someday, I'll be on that center court. Not watching from outside. Playing."* |

### Chapter 10: "The Call" — ~15 pages

**Goal**: THE CLOSING. The mysterious call. Perfect cliffhanger for Volume 2.

| Pg | Scene | Detail |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 1-3 | **First match in national league** | Yadi plays against an experienced professional (30 years old, ranking ~80 national). Loses, but puts up a fight. 6-4, 7-5. Not a humiliation — a statement of intent. The veteran shakes his hand with respect: *"See you soon, kid."* |
| 4-6 | **Recognition** | Commentators take notice: *"This 16-year-old kid just gave a veteran professional a run for his money. Remember the name: Yadi Rodríguez."* Montage of looks from other players. He's no longer invisible. |
| 7-8 | **Moment with Yen** | Yadi and Yen sitting in the empty stands after the tournament. Comfortable silence. Yen: *"You lost the match."* Yadi: *"I know."* Yen: *"And how do you feel?"* Yadi, smiling: *"Hungry."* Yen laughs. Fist bump. |
| 9-11 | **The return** | Yadi returns to the island briefly. Mama Rodríguez hugs him and doesn't let go for a full minute. Papa Rodríguez looks at him seriously, nods: *"Good. But you're not done yet."* Then hugs him too. Don Emilio. Everything the same but everything different. Yadi is no longer the same kid. He's seen the world. But he hasn't lost his roots. Visits the broken court. Hits some balls against the wall, just like the beginning. But now every hit sounds different — stronger, more confident. |
| 12-13 | **The night before** | Yadi in bed, staring at the ceiling. Visual recap: every moment from the volume flashes by — Yen, the first match, Daimon, the final, Charlie, Jani, the big court. Falls asleep with a smile. |
| 14 | **THE CALL** | The phone rings. Yadi picks up, half asleep. A voice on the other end — identity not revealed. All you hear: *"Yadi Rodríguez? I've been watching you. I have a proposal that's going to change your life."* Yadi's eyes snap fully open. Panel of his eyes glowing in the darkness. |
| 15 | **FINAL PAGE — Splash page** | Full panel: Yadi standing, phone to his ear, looking out his humble bedroom window at the stars. The silhouettes of three enormous figures in the sky (the Great 3) as epic shadows. Final text: **"The rise has only just begun."** → **END OF VOLUME 1** / **TO BE CONTINUED IN: YADI RODRÍGUEZ — THE ELITE** |
