# Chapter 10: "The Call"

## ~15 pages | ACT 3: THE HORIZON

---

## Summary

THE VOLUME CLOSING. Yadi plays his first professional match in the national league — loses with dignity against a veteran, but declares his presence to the world. Returns home briefly, reconnects with his roots. And then, at night, the phone rings. The voice on the other end will change everything. The identity of the caller remains the greatest mystery for Volume 2.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Match day. Corona Stadium. Secondary court (not the center — he hasn't earned that yet). But still, the stands hold 3,000. Half full — people curious to see the junior champion face a professional.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi in the locker room. Changes. Looks at himself in the mirror. The bandana. Mama's racket. The invisible mental armor over him.
- **Panel 3**: Yen at the locker room door:

> "Your rival is 30 years old, ranking ~80 national. He's played more professional matches than you've played matches. He has experience, he has fitness, he has a 210 km/h serve."

- **Panel 4**: Yadi:

> "And?"

Yen, half-smile:

> "And you're 16 with a talent he can't buy with 14 years of experience. Have fun."

### PAGE 2

**4 panels — Entrance to the Court**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi walks out into the tunnel leading to the court. The light at the end is more intense than anything before. This is the national league. This is real.
- **Panel 2**: Enters the court. The crowd is different — adults, knowledgeable, journalists. Not the youthful enthusiasm of Youth Arena. It's silent evaluation. They measure him with their eyes.
- **Panel 3**: His rival is already on the court: a 30-year-old man, stocky build, three-day beard, tired but experienced eyes. Looks at Yadi and... smiles kindly. Not with contempt — with curiosity.
- **Panel 4**: They greet each other at the net. The veteran:

> "So you're the kid from the junior tournament. Welcome to the top."

Yadi:

> "Thanks."

> "Don't thank me yet."

---

### PAGE 3

**5 panels — The Match Begins**

- **Panel 1**: The veteran serves. 205 km/h. Yadi returns it — barely. The speed is something else. Everything is faster. More powerful. More real.
- **Panel 2**: Rally. The veteran hits with a depth Yadi hasn't experienced. Every ball pushes him a meter further back. Pure experience.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi tries his game — angles, creativity, instinct. Works on some points. Hits a winner that surprises the veteran and the crowd.
- **Panel 4**: But the veteran adapts fast. Reads Yadi like a book. He's seen hundreds of talented juniors. Knows how to neutralize them.
- **Panel 5**: First set: **6-4 for the veteran.** Yadi played well, but the experience gap is a difference talent can't cover. Not yet.

---

### PAGE 4

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Changeover. Yadi in the chair. Not destroyed — thinking. The veteran gave him more intellectual fight than any junior.
- **Panel 2**: Yen in the stands. Calm. Not worried. Thinks:

> *"He's losing but he's learning. And he's enjoying it. That's what matters."*

- **Panel 3**: Second set. Yadi raises his level. More aggressive, smarter. Diamond Vision flashes appear at key moments. Hits 3 consecutive winners that leave the crowd applauding.
- **Panel 4**: The veteran nods with appreciation — he's not playing against a kid. He's playing against someone who will be dangerous.

---

### PAGE 5

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: But the veteran has a weapon Yadi can't counter: consistency under pressure. At the key moments, he doesn't miss. 15 years of experience translate to absolute cold blood.
- **Panel 2**: 5-5 in the second set. Yadi serving. Crucial game. Double fault on an important point — the nerves, the pressure, the level difference shows.
- **Panel 3**: The veteran breaks Yadi's serve. Serves for the match. 6-5.
- **Panel 4**: Last game. The veteran serves. Powerful serve. Short rally. Winner from the veteran. 40-15. Match point.

---

### PAGE 6

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: Match point. The veteran serves. Yadi returns — a deep return, with grit. 10-shot rally. Yadi fights every ball as if it were his last.
- **Panel 2 (large)**: The veteran closes with a clean backhand down the line. The ball touches the line. Point. Set. Match. **Yadi loses: 4-6, 5-7.** Defeat. But NOT a humiliation. A statement of intent.
- **Panel 3**: Both at the net. Handshake. The veteran, genuine:

> "See you soon, kid."

It's not courtesy. It's certainty. He knows he'll see Yadi again. Probably higher up.

---

### PAGE 7

**4 panels — Recognition**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: In the commentators' booth (or journalists in the press room):

> "This 16-year-old kid just gave a veteran professional ranked 80 a run for his money. He lost, yes, but... remember the name: Yadi Rodríguez."

- **Panel 2**: Quick reaction montage: other players at the tournament who saw the match or the statistics. Looks. Quiet comments. Nobody asks "who is this kid?" anymore. Now the question is "how far can he go?"
- **Panel 3**: Yadi in the locker room, sitting. Lost. But his expression isn't defeat. It's someone who just saw the ceiling and knows he can reach it.
- **Panel 4**: Looks at mama's racket. Strokes it with his fingers. Thinks:

> *"It wasn't enough. Not yet. But I'm closer."*

---

### PAGE 8

**4 panels — Moment with Yen**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Empty stands at Corona Stadium. Afternoon. The tournament continues on other courts, but the court where Yadi played is empty. Yadi and Yen sitting together. Comfortable silence.
- **Panel 2**: Yen:

> "You lost the match."

Yadi:

> "I know."

- **Panel 3**: Yen:

> "And how do you feel?"

- **Panel 4**: Yadi, looking at the empty court in front of them. Smiling:

> "Hungry."

Yen laughs. Genuine. Fist bump. No additional words necessary.

---

### PAGE 9

**4 panels — The Return**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Isla Brava. Yadi's island. Yen's old car parked in front of the Rodríguez house. Golden tropical sunset, palm trees, sea breeze, coquíes starting to sing. The island's vibrant colors — like coming home to a hug.
- **Panel 2**: Mama Rodríguez at the door. Sees him get out of the car. Runs to him. Hugs him and doesn't let go for a full minute. Checks him — arms, legs, face:

> "You're skinny! Didn't you eat?! Did they treat you well?!"

- **Panel 3**: Papa Rodríguez in the doorframe. Serious. Looks at his son. Nods slowly:

> "Good. But you're not done yet."

Pause. Then, unable to contain himself, walks to Yadi and hugs him too. Hard. Long. Mama cries. Papa squeezes his eyes shut.

- **Panel 4**: Yen watches from the car. Smiles. Starts the engine and leaves quietly, giving the moment to the family.

---

### PAGE 10

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Dinner at the Rodríguez house. The usual table. Mama's cooking. Yadi tells them everything — the players, the courts, Charlie, Jani, the match. His eyes shine as he talks. Mama listens with her hand on her chest. Papa eats in silence but doesn't miss a word.
- **Panel 2**: After dinner, Papa washes the dishes (a detail that humanizes him). Mama and Yadi in the living room. She touches his face:

> "You've changed, my love."

> "How?"

> "Your eyes. They have something different. Like... hunger."

Yadi smiles:

> "I guess so."

- **Panel 3**: Yadi leaves the house. Walks to the broken island court. At night. The same stars. The same enormous sky. The sound of the ocean in the background. Luna Borín's mural barely visible in the darkness.
- **Panel 4**: Arrives at the court. Takes a ball from his pocket. Tosses it and hits it against the wall. **SFX: CRACK!!** The sound is different now — stronger, more confident, more dangerous. The mark on the wall is deeper than any previous mark.

---

### PAGE 11

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi hitting against the wall like the beginning of the manga — but everything is different. The posture, the speed, the power, the confidence. Same kid on the same broken court, but he's no longer the same.
- **Panel 2**: Parallel visualization: mirrored panels — on the left, Chapter 1 Yadi hitting rough against the wall. On the right, Yadi now, hitting with authority. Same court. Different player.
- **Panel 3 (large, emotional)**: Yadi stops. Looks at the wall full of marks — old marks from when he started, new marks from now. The story of his evolution written on a concrete wall.

> *"This is where it all started. And it's not over yet."*

---

### PAGE 12

**4 panels — The Night Before**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi goes home. Brushes his teeth. Goes to bed. His room: the Novacronos and Rafa Nal poster on the wall. But now they mean something different — they're no longer just distant idols. They're people who exist in the same world as him. Closer.
- **Panel 2**: Visual recap: small panels with the volume's key moments flashing by — Yen challenging him to play, the first truth, mama's racket, Daimon taunting, the mental armor, glowing eyes against Daimon, the trophy, Charlie smiling at him, Jani walking past without looking.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi in the darkness, smiling. Eyes closed. Peace.
- **Panel 4**: Falls asleep.

---

### PAGE 13 — THE CALL

**4 panels — The Moment**

- **Panel 1**: Darkness. Silence. Yadi asleep.
- **Panel 2**: **RING.** The phone rings. Screen light illuminates the dark room. Yadi stirs.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi picks up the phone. Half asleep. Eyes squinting. Unknown number. Answers by instinct:

> "...Hello?"

- **Panel 4 (large)**: The voice on the other end. Can't see who's speaking. Only a black speech bubble with white letters — different from any other dialogue in the manga. Mysterious. Powerful.

> **"Yadi Rodríguez?"**

Yadi, now fully awake:

> "Yes... who is this?"

---

### PAGE 14

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: The voice:

> **"I've been watching you. For longer than you think."**

Yadi sits up in bed. Heart pounding. Eyes fully open.

- **Panel 2**: The voice:

> **"I have a proposal. One that's going to change your life."**

Yadi:

> "Who... who are you?"

- **Panel 3 (large)**: Close-up of Yadi's eyes in the darkness. Glowing. Not the Diamond Vision — the glow of someone who knows they're on the edge of something enormous. The phone light illuminates half his face. The other half in shadow. His entire world is about to change.

> The voice, just before the page ends:

> **"That... I'll tell you in person."**

---

### PAGE 15 — FINAL PAGE OF THE VOLUME

**Full Splash Page — The Epic Closing**

**Single panel — full page:**

Yadi standing in his humble bedroom. Phone to his ear. Looking out the window at the night sky over Isla Brava. Stars shining over the ocean, palm trees swaying in the breeze, coquíes singing.

But in the sky, reflected in the stars like an epic mirage: **the enormous silhouettes of the three Great 3** — Novacronos on the left (elegant, golden), Rafa Nal in the center (powerful, fire), Noak on the right (enigmatic, calculating). Three giant shadows looking down, like gods of tennis watching the mortal who might join them.

Yadi is small below. But looking up. Without fear.

**Text at the bottom of the page:**

> **"The rise has only just begun."**

---

**Final text:**

> **END OF VOLUME 1**
>
> **YADI RODRÍGUEZ will continue in:**
>
> **VOLUME 2 — "THE ELITE"**

## Artist Notes

- **The match against the veteran**: Not visually epic like Ch 7. More sober, more realistic. Yadi loses. And that's okay. The beauty is in how he loses — with dignity, with hunger, without excuses.
- **The return to the island**: Closing the visual circle. Same tropical colors from Ch 1. Same court with Luna Borín's mural. But Yadi is different. The mirrored panels (Ch 1 vs now) should show that evolution without needing words.
- **THE CALL**: Most tense moments of the volume. The phone in the darkness should feel like a portal. The mysterious voice's speech bubbles must be visually DIFFERENT — black background, white letters, no speech tail (the source is unknown).
- **Final splash page**: THE image of the volume. If this manga were a series, this would be the poster image. Yadi small below, the Great 3 in the sky. Must convey: this is just the beginning. The world is enormous. And this kid is going to conquer it.
- **The voice's identity**: NOT revealed. NO clear clues given. Could be any of the three. That's the magic. The reader should finish the volume with that question: WHO CALLED?

## ACCUMULATED CLUES FOR THE READER

Throughout the volume, the attentive reader will have noticed:

1. **Ch 7**: Mysterious silhouette in the VIP box watching Yadi vs Daimon
2. **Ch 8**: All three legends learn about Yadi (each reacts differently)
3. **Ch 8**: A mysterious hand picking up a phone
4. **Ch 9**: Charlie casually greets Yadi — was it coincidence or was he sent?
5. **Ch 9**: Jani walks past without looking — did he truly not see him or was he evaluating?
6. **Ch 10**: The call — masculine voice, confident, powerful, who's been watching "for longer than you think"

**The answer comes in Volume 2.**
