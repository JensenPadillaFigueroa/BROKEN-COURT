## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGES 1-2 — Double Page: THE ANTECHAMBER

**Double page splash — the most visually epic moment so far**

- **Visual**: The center court of Youth Arena. Full stands — 2,000 people. The tournament has built anticipation. Lights on. Electric atmosphere.
- **Vertical split panel**: The entrance tunnel divided in two. On the left: Yadi — mama's used racket in hand, papa's bandana on his forehead, old but clean athletic clothes, dark and steady eyes. On the right: Daimon — latest-generation racket, impeccable brand-name clothes, full team behind him (coach, physio, assistant), smile of superiority.
- **Narration (text box, top)**:

> *"Money vs. hunger."*

- **Narration (text box, bottom)**:

> *"Privilege vs. will."*

- **In a VIP box, barely visible in the upper corner**: A silhouette sitting alone. Can't see who it is. Just a figure watching. Nobody notices.

### PAGE 3

**5 panels — The First Games**

- **Panel 1**: Both on the court. The umpire announces the match. Daimon wins the toss and elects to serve.
- **Panel 2**: Daimon serves. Devastating serve — flat, fast, down the T. ACE. The sound echoes. **SFX: BOOM!!**
- **Panel 3**: Second serve: ace again. Out wide. Yadi doesn't touch the ball.
- **Panel 4**: Third point: winner from Daimon off the return of Yadi's second serve. Fourth point: ace again. **Game Daimon. 1-0.**
- **Panel 5**: Daimon smiles. Arrogant. Looks at Yadi as if saying "see?". Yen in the stands, thinking:

> *"Easy. Let him throw everything he's got."*

---

### PAGE 4

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi's service game. Serves well — not as powerful as Daimon but with placement. Rally. Yadi's point.
- **Panel 2**: Daimon isn't worried. Wins his serve again. Plays technically better — his shots are cleaner, more polished. Has more formal tools.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi has instinct. Sees angles Daimon doesn't expect. Wins impossible points now and then. But Daimon is consistent.
- **Panel 4**: Score: **4-4.** Even match. They break each other once. The crowd is hooked.

---

### PAGE 5

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: 5-5. Crucial game. Long rally — 15 shots. Both hitting well. Yadi attacks, Daimon resists and counterattacks.
- **Panel 2**: Daimon hits a cross-court winner. Celebrates exaggeratedly looking directly at Yadi. Provocation. But Yadi has the armor — doesn't react.
- **Panel 3**: 6-6. Tie-break. Maximum tension. The crowd in silence. Every point is a world.
- **Panel 4**: Tie-break: alternating points. Mini-break for Daimon at 4-3. He capitalizes on a weak second serve from Yadi. Then closes 7-5.

---

### PAGE 6

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: **First set: Daimon 7-6(5).** Daimon celebrates exaggeratedly. Fist pump. Looks at Yadi, at the stands, at the crowd. Wants everyone to see that he's in charge.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi in his chair. Changeover. Towel on his knees. Head down. But he's not defeated — he's processing.
- **Panel 3 (large, bottom)**: Close-up of Yadi's eyes under the towel. No fear. No frustration. He's in armor mode.

---

### PAGES 7-8 — Double Page: The Moment of Truth

**Yadi's internal sequence — intimate and emotional panels**

- **Panel A**: Yadi with eyes closed. In his mind: Daimon's taunts in the locker room. *"You? With that racket?"*
- **Panel B**: The stares from the first day. The murmurs. The old clothes. The taped racket.
- **Panel C**: Dinner with his parents. The small table. Papa serious asking about the backhand. Mama putting ice on his hands.
- **Panel D**: The note in the tupperware: *"Eat everything. I love you."* And below: *"Win."*
- **Panel E**: Mama handing over the racket: *"If you break it, I'll break you."*
- **Panel F**: Papa at the door: *"Go and be a tiger."*
- **Panel G**: Yen: *"Talent opens the door. Your mind decides if you walk through it."*
- **Panel H (center panel, large)**: Yadi opens his eyes. Not with rage. With PURPOSE. Every memory is fuel. Every sacrifice is reason.

> *"I don't have what they have... but I have something money can't buy."*

### PAGE 9

**3 large panels — FULL ACTIVATION**

- **Panel 1**: Second set begins. Yadi positions to receive Daimon's serve. Something is different. His posture. His aura. The air around him seems to vibrate.
- **Panel 2**: Daimon serves — the same devastating serve from the start. Fast, flat, down the T. The same one that was an ace four times.
- **Panel 3 (LARGE PANEL)**: Close-up of Yadi's eyes — they FULLY ILLUMINATE. Not a flash. Not a flicker. **FULL ACTIVATION OF THE DIAMOND VISION.** Pupils bright like cut diamonds. Trajectory lines of the ball visible in the air — like threads of light showing exactly where the ball is going, when it arrives, and where Yadi needs to be.

> *Time slows down.*

### PAGES 10-11 — Double Page: TOTAL DOMINATION

**EPIC DOUBLE PAGE — the most visually impactful moment of the volume**

**Dynamic panel sequence showing the complete second set:**

- **Panel A (large, left)**: Yadi returns Daimon's serve — the same one that was an ace. Returns it with an aggressive down-the-line return. Winner. Daimon: face of shock. The crowd: collective gasp.
- **Panel B**: Yadi in motion — eyes glowing, trajectory lines visible. Every shot is anticipated. Every move calculated. Sees tennis in slow motion.
- **Panel C**: Winner from Yadi — cross-court forehand with impossible angle. The ball leaves a diamond-like light trail.
- **Panel D**: Another winner — backhand down the line. Daimon runs but doesn't reach it. Not even close.
- **Panel E**: Perfect drop shot. Daimon at the back of the court. The ball bounces twice before Daimon takes three steps.
- **Panel F (large, right)**: Daimon briefly on his knees — not literal, but his posture is defeat. Looks at Yadi as if seeing another person. Who is this kid?
- **Center panel (the largest)**: Yadi mid-swing, eyes glowing, racket in motion, ball launching with a light trail. Behind him, like a ghost shadow, the silhouettes of the Great 3 — as if his potential is awakening to a level that invokes the greats.
- **Score in the corner**: **Yadi 6-1, second set.**
- **The crowd on their feet. Mouths open. Whispers becoming exclamations:**

> *"Who is this kid...?"*

### PAGE 12

**4 panels — Third Set: Destruction**

- **Panel 1**: Third set. Daimon tries to regroup. But psychologically he's broken. For the first time in his life, everything he has — money, team, coach, the best rackets — isn't enough.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi stays in the zone but doesn't overdo it — plays smart, varied, combining everything he's learned. Natural talent + strategy (Ch 5) + mental armor (Ch 6) + the zone (Ch 7). All together.
- **Panel 3**: Daimon makes unforced errors. Looks at his coach seeking help. The coach has no answers. Money has no answers.
- **Panel 4**: Score: **Yadi 5-2, third set.** Match point. The stadium in total silence. 2,000 people holding their breath.

### PAGE 13

**3 large panels — THE FINAL BLOW**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi serving for the match. Tosses the ball. Time freezes visually. Ball suspended. Yadi's eyes glowing underneath.
- **Panel 2 (large, center)**: The serve. The ball travels across the court leaving a diamond trail. Daimon attempts a return — the ball touches his racket but goes wide. Yadi attacks the weak return with a winner to the corner.
- **Panel 3 (large)**: The ball hits exactly on the line. Centimeters from the edge. The line judge leans in. Eternal pause.

> **"IN!"**

**Point. Set. Match. Yadi wins: 6-7(5), 6-1, 6-2.**

---

### PAGE 14 — Silence Then Thunder

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (large)**: One second of absolute silence. Everything frozen. Yadi standing on the court. Racket in hand. Papa's bandana. Eyes returning to normal — the glow fades softly.
- **Panel 2**: Then — the court EXPLODES. The crowd screams, applauds, on their feet. 2,000 people who came to watch a junior tournament and witnessed something extraordinary.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi falls to his knees. Looks at the sky. Tears. Not of sadness — of everything. Relief, pride, validation. Mama's racket on the ground beside him. Papa's bandana on his forehead.
- **Panel 4**: In the stands, Yen. Crying silently. With a smile. Doesn't wipe the tears. Lets them fall.

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing + The Mystery

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Daimon in his chair. Shattered. Looks at his thousand-dollar racket. The racket that wasn't enough. Not destroyed — simply held with hands that no longer trust it. For the first time, Daimon Richwell has no arrogant response. Just silence.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi at the net, waiting for Daimon for the handshake. Daimon stands. Walks. Shakes his hand. Says nothing. Can't. But his eyes say what his mouth won't: *"You're better than me."*
- **Panel 3 (large)**: Yadi from behind, looking at the emptying court. Mama's racket in one hand. Yen coming down from the stands toward him.
- **Panel 4 (FINAL PANEL — SPLASH)**: The VIP box. The mysterious silhouette that watched the entire match. Now standing. Phone in hand. Dialing a number. Can't see the face — only the silhouette against the light. And a smile. Just a smile.

> **Narration**: *"Someone was watching."*

**Closing text**:

## Artist Notes

- **This is the most important chapter of the volume visually.** Must feel like a movie climax. Everything leads here.
- **The activation double page (10-11)** is THE moment of the manga. If there's one image that defines the series, it's this. Yadi with glowing eyes, the Great 3 silhouettes behind him, the ball with a diamond trail.
- **Daimon**: His visual arc goes from invincible arrogance → concern → broken. Don't make him pathetic — make him human. His defeat should generate some empathy. He's a kid who discovered money isn't enough.
- **The family in Yadi's mind** (pgs 7-8): The flashbacks should be warm and soft in contrast with the match intensity. They are Yadi's WHY. His fuel.
- **The VIP box**: ALWAYS at the edge of the panel. Never the focus. The attentive reader notices it. The casual one might not. It's the mystery that pays off in Ch 10.
- **Yadi's celebration** (pg 14): Not a loud celebration. It's intimate. On his knees, looking at the sky, silent tears. As close as possible to the moment of a real athlete winning their first title.
- **Daimon's silence**: His defeat is told without words. Just the expensive racket in trembling hands.
