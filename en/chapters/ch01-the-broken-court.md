## Summary

We introduce Yadi Rodríguez, a 16-year-old with supernatural tennis talent, trapped on a Caribbean tropical island with no resources. We meet his world, his family, and his hunger. At the end of the chapter, a casual encounter with a stranger named Yen reveals for the first time that Yadi has something special.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1 — Opening Splash Page

**Single panel — full page**

- **Visual**: Aerial view of Isla Brava. Caribbean tropical island — palm trees, colorful houses faded by sun and sea salt, narrow streets, wild vegetation, turquoise ocean surrounding everything. In the center of the barrio: a cracked tennis court invaded by tropical weeds, lines almost gone, net sagging on one side. On the court wall: a **massive faded mural of Luna Borín** — the local heroine who won Olympic gold. The mural is eaten by sun and salt but still there.
- **On the court**: A solitary figure — Yadi — hitting a ball against that wall, right next to the mural.
- **Narration (text box, top)**:

> *"In a world where giants rule the court..."*

- **Narration (text box, bottom)**:

> *"...sometimes thunder is born from silence."*

- **Palette**: Vibrant tropicals — turquoise, jungle green, sunset orange, ocean blue. Visible heat in the air.

### PAGE 2

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide, top)**: Close-up of Yadi's feet — worn-out sneakers, the sole peeling off. Stepping on the cracked court, tropical weeds growing through the cracks.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi's hand gripping an old racket — the grip is worn out, wrapped in adhesive tape.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi hits a ball against the wall. The shot is rough but there's something about the arm speed that feels different. Motion lines.
- **Panel 4**: The ball bounces off the wall and comes back. Yadi returns it with a backhand. Smoother this time. A subtle flash.
- **Panel 5 (bottom, wide)**: Don Emilio sitting on an old bench at the edge of the court, smoking a cigarette, machete leaning beside him (for cutting the weeds invading the court), watching Yadi with squinted eyes. In the background: Luna Borín's faded mural and a palm tree. Thought:

> *"This kid again... He's been at it for 3 hours."*

---

### PAGE 3

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi stops, breathing hard, wipes sweat with his shirt (old, faded shirt). Looks at the wall as if it were an opponent.
- **Panel 2**: Close-up of his eyes — dark, intense, but with a spark of something. Not glowing yet, but you can feel the contained energy.
- **Panel 3**: Don Emilio from afar:

> "Hey, kid! It's already 7! Don't you have a home?"

- **Panel 4**: Yadi smiles (first smile of the manga — charismatic, natural):

> "Coming, Don Emilio. One more."

Don Emilio mutters to himself:

> "He always says 'one more'..."

---

### PAGE 4

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi hits the "last" ball. This time the shot is different — cleaner, faster. The ball hits the wall with a sharp, loud sound. **SFX: CRACK.**
- **Panel 2**: Don Emilio raises his eyebrows. The cigarette nearly falls from his mouth. He looks at the mark the ball left on the wall — it's deep.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi gathers his things (a plastic bag with old balls, the racket). Walks toward the exit.
- **Panel 4**: Don Emilio looks at the mark on the wall. Touches the dent with his fingers. Thinks:

> *"What the hell...?"*

---

### PAGES 5-6 — Double Page: FLASHBACK

**Flashback — softer colors, blurred edges**

- **Large center panel**: Young Yadi (8 years old), sitting on the floor in front of an old, small TV. On the screen: the epic final between Roger Novacronos and Rafa Nal. The TV shows Novacronos executing his elegant backhand.
- **Left panel**: Little Yadi's eyes — huge, full of wonder, reflecting the TV screen.
- **Upper right panel**: Papa Rodríguez behind him, serious but with a proud smile. Places the bandana on little Yadi's head. Dialogue:

> "Tennis is the only sport where you play alone against the world, son. So be a tiger."

- **Lower right panel**: Mama Rodríguez beside them, hand on her chest, nervous even watching television:

> "Oh god, these matches are going to kill me!"

- **Small panel, bottom corner**: Little Yadi touches the bandana on his head. Huge smile. His eyes reflect the screen's light.

- **Narration (adult Yadi)**:

> *"That was the day I knew tennis was my thing. Not because it was easy. Because it was impossible."*

---

### PAGE 7

**5 panels — Scene: The Rodríguez House**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Exterior of the Rodríguez house. Small, humble, but well-kept. Painted in faded Caribbean colors (sky blue with yellow trim). Tropical flowers in the window (mama's touch). Salsa music from a neighbor's house. Warm light coming through the open door.
- **Panel 2**: Interior. Dinner. Small table. Papa Rodríguez serious, eating, but asking questions:

> "How was your backhand today? Better than yesterday?"

- **Panel 3**: Yadi, mouth full:

> "I think so. Don Emilio almost fell off his bench."

- **Panel 4**: Papa Rodríguez, not smiling but with a glint in his eyes:

> "Thinking isn't enough. Tomorrow I want you to know it."

- **Panel 5**: Mama Rodríguez sees Yadi's blistered hands while serving him more food. Puts ice on them with a worried face:

> "If you keep this up you're going to have lizard hands. Eat more, you're too skinny."

---

### PAGE 8

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi in his room (small, one bed, an old poster of Novacronos on the wall, another of Rafa Nal, and a magazine clipping of Luna Borín with the gold medal). Tropical breeze through the open window. Places the bandana on the nightstand. Touches it with his fingers.
- **Panel 2**: From the doorway, Mama and Papa Rodríguez watch him without him noticing. Mama whispers:

> "Do you think he'll make it far?"

- **Panel 3**: Papa Rodríguez, serious:

> "That kid has something. He just needs someone to see it."

- **Panel 4 (large bottom panel)**: Yadi asleep. The bandana on the nightstand. The Novacronos poster and Luna Borín photo on the wall lit by moonlight. Sound of coquíes (tropical frogs) outside. The feeling of big dreams in a small room on a small island.

### PAGE 9

**4 panels — Next Day: City Public Courts**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: The public courts at the "Municipal Sports Center." 4 cement courts, better maintained than the island's. Grey buildings around. Early morning. Few people.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi arrives with his plastic bag and racket. Looks at the courts — they're better than anything he's ever seen. Eyes wide.
- **Panel 3**: On one of the courts, a young man (Yen, 23) practices alone. Tall, lean, ponytail, towel on shoulder. Hits the ball with clean technique but no emotion — mechanical.
- **Panel 4**: Yadi watches him through the fence. Fascinated. Thought:

> *"He's good... really good."*

---

### PAGE 10

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yen notices Yadi watching. Pauses. Looks him up and down — notes the old racket, the worn clothes. No judgment, just observation.
- **Panel 2**: Yen, casual, with a half-smile:

> "You playing or just watching?"

- **Panel 3**: Yadi, surprised, pointing at himself:

> "Me?"

- **Panel 4**: Yen tosses a ball to Yadi over the net:

> "I don't see anyone else here."

- **Panel 5**: Yadi catches the ball. Looks at Yen. Looks at the court. His expression changes — from surprise to subtle determination.

> "Let's go."

---

### PAGE 11

**4 panels — The match begins**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Both in position. Yen serves. Clean, precise serve. Yadi barely reacts — the ball passes.
- **Panel 2**: Yen: 15-0. Second serve. Yadi returns this time, but short. Yen puts away an easy winner.
- **Panel 3**: Quick montage of points: Yen dominates. His technique is superior in every way — serve, forehand, backhand, positioning. Yadi runs everything but can't compete. 3-0.
- **Panel 4**: Yen, without arrogance, simply observing:

> *"He's fast... and he doesn't give up. But he's very raw."*

---

### PAGE 12

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi at the back of the court, sweating, frustrated but not beaten. Grips the racket harder.
- **Panel 2**: Yen serves. Yadi returns. Rally. 4 shots, 5, 6. Yadi starts reading the pattern — Yen always goes cross-court after a center shot.
- **Panel 3**: Yen hits to the center. Yadi is already moving before Yen goes cross-court.
- **Panel 4 (large, bottom)**: Yadi hits a passing shot down the line. The angle is impossible — the ball passes brushing the net, hits the line, and rockets away. Yen doesn't reach it. **SFX: WHACK!!**

---

### PAGE 13 — THE MOMENT

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1 (top, wide)**: The ball lands inside the line. A point for Yadi. But it's not a normal point. The speed, the angle, the anticipation — everything was supernatural.
- **Panel 2 (center, close-up)**: Yadi's eyes — for an instant, a FLASH. A glow that wasn't there before. Like a diamond reflecting light. It lasted half a second. Yadi didn't even notice.
- **Panel 3 (bottom, close-up of Yen)**: Yen's eyes completely wide. The towel slipping from his shoulder. Mouth slightly open. Thought:

> *"What... was... that?"*

---

### PAGE 14

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1**: The match continues. Yen wins easily (6-1 or something like that), but he's distracted. Keeps looking at Yadi between points.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi hits another good shot — not as spectacular as the previous one, but there are flashes of something.
- **Panel 3**: End of match. They shake hands at the net. Yadi, respectful:

> "Thanks for the match. You're really good."

- **Panel 4**: Yen, still processing:

> "Yeah... you've got something too."

Yadi, confused:

> "Something?"

- **Panel 5**: Yen doesn't respond. Just looks at him.

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1 (large, top)**: Yadi picking up balls on the other side of the court, humming, not knowing he just changed his life. Back to us. Relaxed.
- **Panel 2**: Yen in the foreground, towel in hand (it fell from his shoulder and he picked it up), watching Yadi from afar. Serious expression. Analytical.
- **Panel 3 (final panel, large)**: Close-up of Yen's face. A half-smile forming. Thought:

> *"What was that...? That kid... doesn't even know what he has."*

**Closing text in bottom corner**:

## Artist Notes

- **Ch 1 Palette**: Vibrant tropical (island — turquoise, green, sunset orange), transitions to colder (city public courts)
- **Isla Brava**: Must feel CARIBBEAN — palm trees, breeze, house colors faded by sun, the ocean always visible or present. Humid heat, not dry. Luna Borín's mural always in the background when Yadi is on the court.
- **Yadi**: Must look humble but charismatic. Old clothes but he looks good in them. Not pathetic — dignified. Brown skin from the tropical sun.
- **The eye flash**: SUBTLE. Barely perceptible. The attentive reader notices it, the casual one might not. It pays off later.
- **Yen**: Introduce him as mysterious — we don't know his intentions yet. Friend or rival?
- **The family**: The dinner scene must feel WARM. Make the reader want to sit down and eat there.
- **Don Emilio**: Visually grumpy — but with details of care (maintains the court for Yadi even though nobody pays him, cuts the tropical weeds with a machete).
- **Luna Borín's mural**: Always visible when Yadi is on the court. Faded by years of sun and sea salt, but still recognizable — a young woman raising a gold medal. It's proof that you can make it off the island.
