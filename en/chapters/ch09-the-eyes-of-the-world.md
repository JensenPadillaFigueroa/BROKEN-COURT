# Chapter 9: "The Eyes of the World"

## ~15 pages | ACT 3: THE HORIZON

## Summary

Yadi receives a wild card for the national professional league. He arrives at the highest level he's ever seen and for the first time feels truly small. He sees Charlie (#1 in the world) and Jani (#2) in person — one smiles at him, the other ignores him. Both moments mark him deeply. Yadi understands the distance between where he is and where he wants to go, but that only ignites his fire further.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: One week after the junior tournament. Yadi at the public courts of the Municipal Sports Center, training with Yen as before. But something is different — Yadi plays with more authority. He's no longer the same kid.
- **Panel 2**: Yen stops the training. Sits on the bench. Takes something from his bag — an official envelope.
- **Panel 3**: Hands it to Yadi. Yadi opens it. Close-up of the contents: a formal letter. National League logos. Key words highlighted: **"WILD CARD"** — **"NATIONAL OPEN TOURNAMENT"** — **"SPECIAL INVITATION"**.
- **Panel 4**: Yadi looks at Yen. Mouth open.

> "Is this...?"

Yen, nodding:

> "National league. Adults. The real professionals."

---

### PAGE 2

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi rereads the letter. His hands tremble again — like when he saw the junior tournament flyer. But this time it's different. It's not fear. It's vertigo.
- **Panel 2**: Yen, serious:

> "It's another level, Yadi. These aren't rich kids playing. These are professionals. Men who live from this. Who train 6 hours a day with full teams. Are you ready?"

- **Panel 3**: Yadi, after a moment. Half-smile:

> "No."

- **Panel 4**: Pause. Yen raises an eyebrow.

> "But I'm going anyway."

Yen laughs:

> "That's the right answer."

### PAGE 3

**4 panels — The Farewell (Brief)**

- **Panel 1**: Vazq house. Yadi packing his bag (a bit better than the first time — same old backpack, but now he has the junior trophy in his room).
- **Panel 2**: Mama, nervous as always:

> "National league? With adults? Son, those guys are huge. What if they hurt you?"

Yadi:

> "Ma, it's tennis, not boxing."

Mama:

> "It's the same thing! Those serves can kill you!"

- **Panel 3**: Papa, from the table, reading the newspaper (which has a small article about Yadi):

> "Leave him. He's a tiger. Tigers aren't afraid of anything."

Looks at Yadi over the newspaper:

> "Right?"

- **Panel 4**: Yadi, smiling:

> "Right."

### PAGE 4

**3 large panels — Arrival at Corona Stadium**

- **Panel 1 (large, wide)**: Exterior of "Corona Stadium" — the complex hosting the National League. ENORMOUS. Center court with 10,000 seat capacity. Multiple secondary courts. Giant screens. Another planet compared to Youth Arena. Yadi and Yen standing in front of the entrance, tiny.
- **Panel 2**: Interior. Everything is bigger, faster, more intense. Professional players warming up — taller, stronger, faster than anything Yadi has seen. Coaches with headsets. Television cameras.
- **Panel 3 (large)**: Close-up of Yadi. Huge eyes. For the first time since he started his journey, he feels genuinely small. Not insecure — awestruck. Like a kid at Disneyland, but Disneyland is professional tennis.

> Thought: *"This... is another world."*

---

### PAGE 5

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi on his assigned practice court. Hitting balls alone while Yen watches from the bench.
- **Panel 2**: Other players on adjacent courts. Their shots sound different — more powerful, faster. The balls travel faster than anything Yadi has experienced.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi notices a veteran player (30+) practicing his serve on the next court. Every serve exceeds 200 km/h. The sound is like a cannon. Yadi swallows hard.
- **Panel 4**: Yen, from the bench:

> "Welcome to real tennis."

---

### PAGES 6-7 — Double Page: THE ENCOUNTER WITH CHARLIE

**The most important moment of the chapter — the first time Yadi sees a world star in person.**

- **Panel 1 (left, wide)**: Yadi practicing. Suddenly, movement on the adjacent court. An entourage of people — coach, physio, assistant, cameras — surrounding someone.
- **Panel 2**: The crowd parts and there he is: **CHARLIE** — the #1 in the world. In person. Meters away. Curly hair, constant smile, eyes that shine with pure energy. His presence fills the space. He's not just a player — he's a force of nature.
- **Panel 3 (large center panel of the double page)**: Charlie starts warming up. DOUBLE PAGE SPLASH: Charlie hitting a forehand. The ball travels with a power and precision Yadi has never seen in person. Visual speed trail. The sound is different — cleaner, deeper, more REAL than anything on TV. The ground almost trembles with each shot.

> **SFX: CRACK!!!**

- **Panel 4 (right)**: Yadi frozen. Racket in hand, ball in the other, but he doesn't move. He's hypnotized. Mouth slightly open.

> Thought: *"This... this is the #1 in the world."*

- **Panel 5 (bottom right corner)**: Yen watching Yadi watching Charlie. Thinks:

> *"That's how you ignite a dream."*

---

### PAGE 8

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Charlie practices for 10 minutes. Every shot is a masterpiece. Forehand, backhand, serve, volley — everything is perfect. Varied. Explosive and elegant at the same time.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi keeps watching. Can't stop watching. Other players on nearby courts also glance over — Charlie is magnetic even to professionals.
- **Panel 3**: Charlie finishes. Dries off with his towel. Walks toward the court exit... and passes by Yadi's court.
- **Panel 4 (large)**: Charlie notices Yadi. Looks at him. Yadi freezes. Direct eye contact between the #1 in the world and a 16-year-old kid from a tropical island that doesn't even show up on the map. Charlie SMILES. Gives him a gesture with his racket — a casual greeting, like pointing it at him and nodding.

> Charlie, simple: "Hey."

---

### PAGE 9

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi can't speak. Just raises his hand in an awkward wave. Charlie has already passed. Gone. The moment lasted 3 seconds.
- **Panel 2**: For Yadi it was an earthquake. Stands there looking in the direction Charlie went. His heart pounds.
- **Panel 3**: Yen, amused:

> "Are you breathing?"

Yadi:

> "I don't think so."

- **Panel 4**: Yen:

> "He's just a guy with a racket. Like you."

Yadi:

> "No. He's not like me. Not yet."

Yen smiles at the "not yet."

### PAGE 10

**4 panels — JANI**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Later. Yadi walking through the complex toward the locker rooms. Main hallway. Players and staff coming and going.
- **Panel 2**: A presence approaches. The hallway seems to grow colder. People step aside unconsciously. **Jani** — the #2 in the world — walks in the opposite direction. Tall, red-haired, absolutely cold and controlled expression. Impeccable clothes. Aura of royalty. Doesn't look at anyone. Doesn't speak to anyone. Two assistants walk behind him in silence.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi stops. Watches him. Jani's presence is different from Charlie's — where Charlie radiated warmth, Jani radiates distance. Silent power. Yadi thinks:

> *"It's like watching Novacronos in the videos... but young."*

- **Panel 4**: Jani passes by him. Centimeters away. Without looking at him. Without acknowledging his existence. A chill runs through Yadi. Jani disappears down the hallway.

---

### PAGE 11

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi stands in the hallway. Jani's wake still lingers. Cold.
- **Panel 2**: Thinks:

> *"Charlie saw me and smiled. Jani passed like I didn't exist."*

- **Panel 3**: Pause.

> *"Both motivated me equally."*

- **Panel 4**: Yadi clenches his fists at his sides. Not from frustration — from resolution.

> *"Someday, Jani will look at me. Not because he wants to. Because he won't have a choice."*

---

### PAGE 12

**4 panels — Night Reflection**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Night. Complex hotel. Yadi in his room — the cheapest, the smallest. View of a parking lot instead of the courts. He doesn't care.
- **Panel 2**: Sitting on the bed. Takes out papa's bandana. Looks at it. Touches it with his fingers.
- **Panel 3**: Thinks out loud, whispering:

> "Dad... I'm here. I'm where I always dreamed."

- **Panel 4 (large)**: Close-up of his face. Wet eyes but not sad — moved. Full of something enormous that has no name. Awe + determination + fear + hope, all together.

> "And it's bigger than I imagined."

---

### PAGE 13

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi lying down, staring at the ceiling. Thinks about Charlie hitting the ball. The sound. The speed.
- **Panel 2**: Thinks about Jani walking without looking at him. The cold. The distance.
- **Panel 3**: Thinks about the island court. The cracked wall with Luna Borín's mural. Don Emilio on the bench. The ocean. How far away that feels.
- **Panel 4**: Covers his eyes with his arm. Smiles. A smile that mixes everything: the fear and the hope, the distance and the desire.

> *"The distance is enormous. But I've already taken the first step."*

---

### PAGE 14

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi gets up from bed. Walks to the bathroom. Looks at himself in the mirror.
- **Panel 2**: Puts on the bandana. Looks himself straight in the eyes.
- **Panel 3 (large, powerful panel)**: Yadi looking at himself in the mirror. Bandana on. Dark eyes, steady, with a glow that isn't the Diamond Vision — it's pure human will.

> "Someday, I'll be on that center court. Not watching from outside. Playing."

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi lies down. Turns off the light. The room in shadow. Only the light from parking lot lamps coming through the window.
- **Panel 2**: Close-up of the bandana on the nightstand. Next to it, the wild card letter.
- **Panel 3 (final panel, large)**: View from outside the window. Yadi asleep in the small hotel bed. The silhouette of Corona Stadium visible in the distance, illuminated. Enormous against the night sky. Yadi small in bed. The stadium giant on the horizon.

> **Narration**: *"The world of the greats was out there. Waiting."*

**Closing text**:

> → Chapter 10: "The Call"

## Artist Notes

- **Charlie vs Jani**: The visual contrast between these two encounters is EVERYTHING. Charlie = light, warmth, energy, smile. Jani = cold, distance, silence, cutting aura. Yadi reacts intensely to both but in opposite ways.
- **The Charlie double page** (pgs 6-7): Must be IMPACTFUL. Charlie hitting the ball should look superhuman — not literally, but the power and elegance must leap off the page. It's the first time Yadi (and the reader) sees the highest level in the world.
- **Jani passing without looking**: Powerful moment in its minimalism. No eye contact. No words. Just a presence that passes like an iceberg. The absence of recognition is more powerful than any dialogue.
- **The hotel room**: Must look humble but not pathetic. It's the room of someone who's starting out, not someone who failed. The junior trophy isn't here — it's at home. Yadi travels light.
- **Final panel**: Composition is key — Yadi small in the foreground, Corona Stadium ENORMOUS in the background. The distance between them is literal and metaphorical. But Yadi is already closer than he was.
