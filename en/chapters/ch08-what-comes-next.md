## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Exterior of Youth Arena. Golden sunset. The tournament continues — there are more matches, but the murmur is about only one: Yadi Rodríguez.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi and Yen walking through the complex after the match against Daimon. Yadi still has the bandana on. Walks in silence. Processing.
- **Panel 3**: Yen:

> "How are you?"

- **Panel 4**: Yadi, honest:

> "I don't know. I think I still can't believe it."

Yen, soft tap on the back:

> "Believe it. Because tomorrow there's a semi-final."

### PAGE 2

**5 panels — The Call Home**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi in his hotel room (the cheapest in the complex). Takes out his phone. Dials home.
- **Panel 2**: Mama answers before the second ring. The scream can be heard from the earpiece — Yadi has to pull the phone away from his ear:

> "SON!!! YOU WON!! Don't tell me anything, I already know, your papa was glued to the phone waiting for results! Are you okay?! Did you get hurt?! Did you eat?!"

- **Panel 3**: Yadi, laughing:

> "Ma, I'm fine. I won."

> "I KNOW YOU WON!! I had a heart attack! I almost called an ambulance! And that Daimon?! The one with the luxury car?! Tell me you crushed him!"

- **Panel 4**: Yadi:

> "I beat him, ma."

Silence. A sob is heard. Mama crying with pride. Whispers:

> "I'm so proud of you, my love."

- **Panel 5**: Papa takes the phone. Serious voice but it cracks:

> "Good match. Now the next one."

Pause.

> "...I'm proud, son."

Yadi closes his eyes. His lip trembles. Doesn't cry. But he's close.

### PAGE 3

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi after hanging up. Looks at mama's note (from the tupperware) which he taped to his room wall with adhesive tape. Smiles.
- **Panel 2**: On Isla Brava, Papa Rodríguez hangs up the phone. Mama still crying. Papa hugs her. Serious on the outside. Destroyed with emotion on the inside.
- **Panel 3**: Don Emilio at his front door. A neighbor shows him something on the phone — a sports article about the tournament. Don Emilio adjusts his glasses, reads, and smiles big.
- **Panel 4**: Don Emilio at the broken island court, alone, looking at the wall with Luna Borín's mural where Yadi used to practice. The ball marks are still there next to the faded mural. Thinks:

> *"I knew it, kid. I knew it."*

---

### PAGE 4

**4 panels — The Circuit Takes Notice**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Media montage: computer screen with sports article: *"Yadi Rodríguez: the unknown who destroyed the #1 junior"*. Another screen: video clip — Yadi's passing shot against Daimon. Social media: comments: *"Where did this kid come from?"* *"Look at his eyes in the second set."* *"The kid with the old racket."*
- **Panel 2**: Journalists at the complex talking among themselves:

> "Does anyone have info on this Rodríguez? He doesn't show up in any academy records."
> "Because he doesn't come from any academy."

- **Panel 3**: The tournament director in his office, looking at Yadi's statistics on his computer. Raises his eyebrows.
- **Panel 4**: A sports commentator recording a video:

> "Ladies and gentlemen, remember this name: Yadi Rodríguez. He's 16 years old, comes from an island that doesn't even show up on the map, and just did something you don't see every day on the junior circuit."

---

### PAGE 5

**4 panels — Semi-Final (Quick Summary)**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Semi-final. Yadi against a solid player (#4 ranking). The full match isn't detailed — it's a quick montage.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi plays with confidence but without arrogance. Mixes everything he's learned: the loose game (Ch 4), strategy (Ch 5), the mental armor (Ch 6), and flashes of the zone (Ch 7).
- **Panel 3**: Final point: Yadi wins a long rally with a clean winner. Victory: 6-3, 6-4. Solid. No drama. Professional.
- **Panel 4**: Yen in the stands, calm:

> Thought: *"He doesn't need comebacks anymore. He's playing like what he's been since the beginning."*

---

### PAGE 6

**4 panels — The Final**

- **Panel 1**: Final day. Center court. Full stands again — this time everyone came for Yadi. His name is everywhere.
- **Panel 2**: The rival is strong but doesn't have Daimon's emotional story or Luca's tricks. It's a technical, clean match.
- **Panel 3 (wide)**: Point montage: Yadi dominating. Not with the explosion of Ch 7, but with maturity. Reads the game, constructs points, closes when he should.
- **Panel 4**: **Victory: Yadi 6-4, 6-3. NATIONAL JUNIOR CHAMPION.**

---

### PAGE 7

**3 large panels — The Ceremony**

- **Panel 1 (large)**: Award ceremony. Yadi on the center podium. They hand him the trophy. It's bigger than anything he's ever had. Lifts it with both hands.
- **Panel 2**: The crowd applauds. Yen in the stands — standing, clapping softly, eyes shining. A nod worth more than a thousand trophies.
- **Panel 3 (large, emotional)**: Close-up of Yadi holding the trophy. He's not looking at the trophy — he's looking at Yen. Eye contact between the two. Everything said without words.

> **Narration (Yadi)**: *"This trophy has my name on it. But it has many people's hands on it."*

---

### PAGE 8

**4 panels — Post-Ceremony**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi in the locker room with the trophy. Alone. Sets it on the bench and looks at it. Takes out the bandana, places it next to the trophy. Mental photo.
- **Panel 2**: Takes out his phone. Sends a photo to his parents. Mama responds in 3 seconds: 47 heart and crying face emojis. Papa: a thumbs up. Then, 30 seconds later, another message from papa: *"The trophy looks good. But I want to see more."*
- **Panel 3**: Yadi laughs. Puts the phone away. Looks at the trophy again.
- **Panel 4**: Yen knocks on the door. Peeks in:

> "Congratulations, champion. Now let's go before they give you more trophies."

Yadi laughs. Grabs his things. They leave.

### PAGE 9

**Transition page — Wide top panel + 3 bottom panels**

- **Top panel (panoramic)**: Aerial view of the sports complex at sunset. Yadi and Yen walking toward the parking lot, small in the frame. End of the tournament.

- **Bottom center panel**: Text: *"...thousands of kilometers away..."*
- **Bottom right panel**: Text: *"...the eyes of the world were beginning to open."*

### PAGE 10 — Novacronos's Eyes

**3 large panels — SILENCE — No dialogue, only image**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: "Tower of Time" — Roger Novacronos's private academy in Europe. Elegant exterior. Perfect grass courts. An antique clock in the tower.
- **Panel 2**: Interior of his office. Elegant, minimalist, full of trophies and photos with kings and presidents. Novacronos sitting in a leather armchair, reading something on his tablet. His grey hair impeccably combed. Perfect suit.
- **Panel 3 (large, close-up)**: Novacronos raises an eyebrow. On the tablet screen: an article with Yadi's photo holding the trophy. Novacronos says nothing. Just looks. His golden eyes fixed on the image. A glint of interest.

### PAGE 11 — Rafa Nal's Eyes

**3 large panels — SILENCE**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: "Bull Fortress" — Rafa Nal's training center. Clay courts surrounded by mountains. Rustic but functional. Young players training.
- **Panel 2**: Rafa Nal supervising a training session. Muscular even in retirement. Old bandana on his wrist. An assistant approaches and shows him something on a phone — a video.
- **Panel 3 (large, close-up)**: Rafa Nal's eyes widen. On the phone screen: a clip of Yadi hitting the passing shot against Daimon — the impossible angle. Rafa Nal recognizes something. His hand closes into a fist, not from anger — from emotion. He sees in that kid something that reminds him of someone: himself.

### PAGE 12 — Noak's Eyes

**3 large panels — SILENCE**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: A generic sports complex. Noak just finished an exhibition/veterans' match. Walking through the hallway, towel around his neck, water bottle.
- **Panel 2**: His personal assistant walks beside him. Shows him a tablet with statistics and data. Noak glances sideways while walking.
- **Panel 3 (large, close-up)**: Noak stops. Looks at the tablet carefully. On the screen: Yadi's statistics — serve speed, winner percentage, points won on second serve. Noak smiles. Enigmatically. The smile of someone who just saw something the rest of the world doesn't yet understand.

> Thought (only text in all 3 pages): *"Interesting."*

---

### PAGE 13

**3 panels — THE PHONE HAND**

- **Panel 1**: Black panel with white text:

> *"And then... someone decided to act."*

- **Panel 2 (large)**: A hand — can't see who it belongs to — picking up a phone. The hand is strong, well-kept, with an elegant watch. Could be any of the three.
- **Panel 3**: Close-up of the phone. The screen lights up. A contact list. A finger scrolls. Stops on a name that can't be seen — it's cut off by the panel edge. The finger presses "call."

> The phone starts ringing...

---

### PAGE 14

**4 panels — Transition to the Future**

- **Panel 1**: Back in Yadi's world. Night. Yadi and Yen in Yen's old car, returning from the tournament. The trophy in the back seat.
- **Panel 2**: Comfortable silence. Window open. Stars visible.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi:

> "Yen."

> "Hm?"

> "Thanks."

- **Panel 4**: Yen, eyes on the road. A smile:

> "Don't thank me. This is just the beginning."

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1 (large)**: Yen's car on the coastal road at night. Headlights illuminating the path. Enormous starry sky. The ocean on one side, the lights of Isla Brava in the distance.
- **Panel 2**: Close-up of the trophy in the back seat, shining with moonlight through the window.
- **Panel 3 (final panel)**: Yadi asleep in the passenger seat. Bandana still on. A sleeping smile. Yen driving in silence, watching the road. Protective.

> **Narration**: *"A trophy in the back seat. A champion asleep. And somewhere in the world, a phone ringing."*

**Closing text**:

> → Chapter 9: "The Eyes of the World"

## Artist Notes

- **Pages 10-12 (The Legends)**: These 3 pages are CRUCIAL. Must feel like opening a window to another world. Each legend has its own color palette and atmosphere:
  - **Novacronos**: Golds, creams, elegance. European architecture.
  - **Rafa Nal**: Earth, orange, mountains. Rustic and powerful.
  - **Noak**: Neutrals, greys, minimalist. Everything is functional.
- **No dialogue on the legend pages** (except Noak's thought). The silence says everything. Facial expressions do the work.
- **The phone hand** (pg 13): Deliberately ambiguous. The hand should have no identifying features beyond "someone powerful." The mystery is the hook.
- **The final car scene**: Must feel like a breather after the storm. Peace. Warmth. Yadi asleep with the smile of someone who did something he didn't think possible.
- **The parents' messages** (pg 8): The contrast mama (47 emojis) vs papa (thumbs up → "I want to see more") is pure humor+emotion. Defining the family in two text messages.
