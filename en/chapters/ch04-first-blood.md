## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Morning of the first tournament day. Youth Arena. Tense atmosphere. Players warming up, stretching, talking with coaches.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi in the locker room, alone. Sitting on the bench facing his open locker. Looks at the racket. Looks at his hands. Hands trembling slightly.
- **Panel 3**: Closes his eyes. Remembers Yen's voice:

> *"Don't think about winning. Think about each ball. One at a time."*

- **Panel 4**: Opens his eyes. Takes out papa's bandana. Puts it on in front of the mirror. Looks at himself. Breathes.

> *"Be a tiger."*

### PAGE 2

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi walks out into the hallway leading to the courts. Light at the end. Sound of balls and crowd.
- **Panel 2**: From the stands, Yen watches him walk toward the court. Arms crossed. Neutral face.
- **Panel 3 (large)**: Yadi enters the court. Secondary court, not center, but still the biggest thing he's seen up close. Scattered crowd in the stands — about 200 people. For Yadi, it might as well be 20,000.
- **Panel 4**: His rival is already there: player #15 in the rankings. Perfect uniform, professional bag, coach in his corner. Everything Yadi doesn't have.

### PAGE 3

**5 panels — First set: Disaster**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi serves. The serve goes long. Fault. Second serve — weak, to the center. The rival hits a return winner.
- **Panel 2**: Second game. Yadi is tense. Every shot is forced, mechanical. Misses an easy forehand into the net.
- **Panel 3**: 0-3. The crowd murmurs. Some laugh quietly:

> "Where did this guy come from?"

- **Panel 4**: In the stands, Daimon watches with arms crossed. Dismissive smile:

> "This is the one who was going to face me? What a waste."

- **Panel 5**: Yadi loses another game. 0-4. His body is rigid. His mind is everywhere: on Daimon, on the crowd, on what they'll think if he loses. On everything except the ball.

### PAGE 4

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Changeover. Yadi sitting in his chair. Towel on his face. Hands still trembling.
- **Panel 2**: Looks toward the stands. Sees Yen. Yen doesn't signal, doesn't shout. Just looks at him. Steady. Calm.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi lowers his gaze. Sees mama's note peeking from his pocket. Thinks of papa: *"You lost? Good. Now tell me what you'll do differently."*
- **Panel 4**: First set: 6-2 for the rival. Yadi stands up from the chair. Looks defeated... but something is changing.

### PAGE 5

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Start of the second set. Yadi positions to receive serve. Closes his eyes for a second.
- **Panel 2**: Quick flashback — a single superimposed panel: Yen in training:

> *"When everything goes against you, let go. Stop fighting yourself. Play."*

- **Panel 3**: Yadi opens his eyes. Something is different. His posture relaxes. Shoulders drop. Jaw loosens.
- **Panel 4 (large, bottom)**: Yadi smiles. It's the first smile of the match. Not forced — genuine. As if he suddenly remembered this is a game. That it's supposed to be FUN.

> Thought: *"Let go. Just let go."*

### PAGE 6

**5 panels — The Transformation begins**

- **Panel 1**: The rival serves. Yadi returns — but different. The shot is loose, natural, with angle. The rival is surprised.
- **Panel 2**: Rally. 6 shots. Yadi moves with fluidity — no longer fighting himself. Reads the game. Anticipates.
- **Panel 3**: Winner from Yadi down the line. Clean. Fast. The rival doesn't react.
- **Panel 4**: 15-0. Yadi doesn't celebrate, but his eyes have a subtle flash. The Diamond Vision is starting to awaken.
- **Panel 5**: Yen in the stands. Uncrosses his arms for the first time. Subtle lean forward.

> Thought: *"There it is."*

### PAGE 7

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Point montage: Yadi winning game after game. His shots are cleaner, more aggressive, with angles that shouldn't work but do.
- **Panel 2**: The rival starts getting frustrated. Looks at his coach seeking answers. The coach has none.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi hits a cross-court passing shot. The ball grazes the line. **IN.** The line judge leans in to confirm. Visual victory.
- **Panel 4**: Score: Yadi 5-1 in the second set. The crowd is silent — but a different silence. No longer mockery. It's attention.

### PAGE 8

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 3 (bottom, large)**: **Second set: Yadi 6-1.** The rival looks at Yadi as if he were another person. Because he is. The Yadi from the first set died at the changeover.

---

### PAGE 9

**4 panels — Third set**

- **Panel 1**: Third set. The rival tries to react, raises the intensity. But Yadi has already found his rhythm.
- **Panel 2**: Long rally. 15 shots. Yadi patient, moving the rival side to side, waiting for the moment.
- **Panel 3**: He sees it — the opening. The rival is far from center. Yadi hits to the empty space. Winner.
- **Panel 4**: 3-1 Yadi. Yadi's serve: ace down the T. His first ace in an official match. The sound echoes.

---

### PAGE 11

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi on the court. Moment of shock. Looks at his hands — as if he can't believe what they just did. Mama's racket in one hand. Papa's bandana on his forehead.
- **Panel 2**: The rival crosses the net. Shakes his hand. No resentment:

> "Good match, kid. In the second set... what happened to you?"

Yadi, honest:

> "I don't know. I just stopped thinking."

- **Panel 3 (large, bottom)**: Yadi from behind, walking toward the court exit. The scattered crowd applauds — not wildly, but with genuine respect. The murmur has changed:

> "Who is that kid?"
> "Where did he come from?"
> "Did you see that second set?"

### PAGE 12

**4 panels — Reactions**

- **Panel 1**: Daimon in the stands. No longer smiling. Frowns for the first time. His coach whispers something. Daimon doesn't respond.
- **Panel 2**: Kai Morimoto, sitting alone as always. But now looking toward the court where Yadi played. His eyes, for the first time, show a spark of interest.
- **Panel 3**: Luca Santori, leaning on the railing. Smile intact, but his eyes are calculating:

> Thought: *"Interesting..."*

- **Panel 4**: Yen in the stands. Arms crossed again. Nodding imperceptibly. The slightest smile at the corner of his mouth.

---

- **Panel 2**: Message from papa (sent one minute later): *"Good first match. The next one will be harder. Rest."*
- **Panel 3**: Yadi smiles. Puts the phone away. Looks at the tournament bracket on the locker room wall. His name advances. Next rival: **Kai Morimoto — #3.**
- **Panel 4**: Yadi touches Kai's name on the bracket. Thinks:

> *"The Silent Wall..."*

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Elsewhere in the club, Kai Morimoto is alone on an empty court, practicing returns against a ball machine. Every ball comes back. All of them. No exception. Impassive.
- **Panel 2 (large)**: Split image — Yadi on the left looking at the bracket, Kai on the right on the court. An imaginary line connects them. Two worlds about to collide.
- **Panel 3**: Close-up of Kai's eyes. Cold. Relentless. For the first time, a thought:

> *"Yadi Rodríguez. Let's see what you've got."*

**Closing text**:

> → Chapter 5: "The Wall"

## Artist Notes

- **First set vs Second set**: The visual change must be DRASTIC. First set: tight panels, tense lines, rigid body. Second set: more open panels, fluid lines, loose body.
- **The smile on page 5**: Key moment of the volume. When Yadi smiles and decides to ENJOY tennis. Must feel like a breath of relief after the suffocation of the first set.
- **The parents' texts**: A moment of humor and tenderness amid tension. The contrast between mama (hysterical with joy) and papa (stoic but emotional) defines their dynamic.
- **Rival reactions** (pg 12): Each one reacts differently and consistent with their personality. Daimon worried, Kai interested, Luca calculating.
- **Closing with Kai**: Must feel ominous. Kai isn't a normal rival — he's something Yadi has never faced. The ball machine is a visual metaphor for what's coming.
