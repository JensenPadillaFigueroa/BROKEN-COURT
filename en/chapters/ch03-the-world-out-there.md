## Summary

Yadi leaves his island for the first time to compete in the National Junior Tournament. Brutal culture shock: perfect courts, rich players, elite teams. We meet the three main rivals — Daimon Richwell, Kai Morimoto, and Luca Santori. Yadi is verbally humiliated by Daimon but channels his rage into determination.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1 — The Farewell

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Exterior of the Rodríguez house. Dawn. Small suitcase at the door. Yadi with his usual bag + an old backpack.
- **Panel 2**: Mama Rodríguez hands him something wrapped in gift paper (recycled). Teary eyes but smiling:

> "Here. It's not new, but it has all my love."

- **Panel 3**: Yadi opens the package — a used racket but in much better condition than his. New grip, freshly strung. Yadi touches it like it's treasure.
- **Panel 4**: Mama, wiping her tears with her usual sarcasm:

> "If you break it, I'll break you."

- **Panel 5**: Yadi hugs her tight. She squeezes harder.

---

### PAGE 2

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Papa Rodríguez, serious, puts his hand on his shoulder. Looks him straight in the eyes:

> "Go and be a tiger. Don't be afraid of anyone."

- **Panel 2**: Yadi nods. Firm eyes. Handshake between father and son — strong, masculine, full of everything they don't say with words.
- **Panel 3**: Mama is openly crying now. Papa too, but hides it looking away and coughing.

> Mama: "Call me when you get there! And eat well! And don't stay up late!"

- **Panel 4 (large, bottom)**: Yadi walking down the colorful island street toward where Yen waits with an old car. The Rodríguez house behind, painted in faded sky blue, with his parents at the door. Palm trees, sea breeze. Don Emilio leaning against the court gate, arms crossed:

> "Go, kid. This court is too small for you now."

---

### PAGE 3

**4 panels — The journey**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Yen's car on a road. Open countryside. Enormous sky. Yadi looks out the window.
- **Panel 2**: Car interior. Yadi with the new racket on his lap, touching it. Yen drives in silence.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi:

> "Yen... what's it like?"

> "What's what like?"

> "There. The tournament. The other players."

- **Panel 4**: Yen, eyes on the road:

> "Different. They have everything you don't. Except what matters."

---

### PAGE 4

**4 panels — Arrival**

- **Panel 1 (large, wide)**: The National Junior Club — "Youth Arena." Yadi and Yen standing in front of the entrance. Modern building, clean, bright. Perfect courts visible through glass. Sponsor logos everywhere. Yadi looks tiny in front of all this.
- **Panel 2**: Interior. Lobby. Players in brand-name clothes, professional bags, latest-generation rackets (3 or 4 each). Coaches with tablets, nutritionists with clipboards. A completely different world.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi in the middle of it all, with his old backpack, his used racket (mama's new one), and his worn-out athletic clothes. The stares. Subtle but real. Some see him and look away. Others murmur.
- **Panel 4**: Close-up of Yadi. Swallows hard. Feels out of place for the first time. But grips the handle of his racket.

---

### PAGE 5

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yen, behind him, voice low:

> "They've already started judging you. Good. Let them. You didn't come here to make friends."

- **Panel 2**: Yadi nods. Straightens his back.
- **Panel 3 (wide)**: They walk through the hallway toward the locker rooms. Through the glass you see the courts — perfect green, taut nets, impeccable white lines. Yadi stops for a second to look.
- **Panel 4**: Close-up of Yadi's eyes reflecting the courts. A flash. But this time it's not his power — it's pure hunger.

> Thought: *"This is real."*

---

### PAGE 6 — Rival Introductions (Manga Presentation Panel)

**Full page manga-style introduction — stylized panels with name, ranking, and visual**

**Top panel — DAIMON RICHWELL**:
- Arrives in a luxury car (black SUV with tinted windows). Gets out like he's famous. Blonde, perfect skin, brand-name clothes, 4 rackets in a professional bag. Entourage: personal coach, physiotherapist, an assistant carrying his things. Arrogant smile.
- **Text**: DAIMON RICHWELL — #1 National Junior Ranking — "The Golden Boy"

**Center panel — KAI MORIMOTO**:
- Sitting alone in a corner of the lobby. Short, stocky, completely impassive expression. Reading something on his phone. Doesn't talk to anyone. Doesn't need anyone.
- **Text**: KAI MORIMOTO — #3 National Junior Ranking — "The Silent Wall"

**Bottom panel — LUCA SANTORI**:
- Leaning against a pillar, watching everyone who enters with a permanent smile that doesn't reach his eyes. Thin, narrow eyes, calculating.
- **Text**: LUCA SANTORI — #5 National Junior Ranking — "The Viper"

**Small corner panel**: Yadi going unnoticed among everyone. No introduction text. Invisible.

---

### PAGE 7

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi in the locker rooms, finding his locker. Everything is modern and clean. Other players have enormous bags, change clothes like it's a fashion show.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi opens his old backpack — clothes carefully folded by mama, a small towel, papa's bandana, and a tupperware with homemade food.
- **Panel 3**: Note inside the tupperware, mama's handwriting: *"Eat everything. I love you. Win or lose, you're my champion."* Below, in papa's handwriting, added with a different pen: *"Win."*
- **Panel 4**: Yadi smiles. Puts the note in his pocket. Puts on the bandana.

---

### PAGE 8

**5 panels — The Provocation**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi closing his locker. Behind him, a group approaches. Laughter.
- **Panel 2**: Daimon Richwell. Standing in front of him with two companions. Looks Yadi up and down. Stops at the racket. Stops at the sneakers. Stops at the clothes.
- **Panel 3**: Daimon, condescending smile:

> "You? With that racket?"

- **Panel 4**: Laughter from the group. Another player:

> "This isn't charity, right?"

- **Panel 5**: Daimon, leaning slightly:

> "Listen, this is professional tennis. I don't know how you got in, but... good luck."

He says it as if "good luck" means "you don't stand a chance."

---

### PAGE 9

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi doesn't respond. Stands still. His fists clench at his sides. Jaw tight.
- **Panel 2**: Close-up of Yadi's eyes — contained rage. But he doesn't explode.
- **Panel 3**: Yen appears behind Yadi. Calm voice, hand on his shoulder:

> "Save that rage. You'll need it on the court."

- **Panel 4**: Daimon looks at Yen, dismisses him with a gesture, and leaves with his group. Yadi exhales.

> Yen: "You okay?"
> Yadi: "I'm furious."
> Yen: "Good. Now turn that into points."

---

### PAGE 10

**4 panels — The Tournament Bracket**

- **Panel 1 (large)**: Main hall. Big screen with the tournament bracket. All players gathered, watching. Murmurs, analysis, nerves.
- **Panel 2**: Close-up of the bracket. Yadi's name in the bottom half. Clear path: if he advances, he faces a lesser rival in the first round, then potentially Kai Morimoto, then Luca Santori, and Daimon would wait in the zone final.
- **Panel 3**: Kai Morimoto looks at the bracket without expression. Luca Santori smiles seeing his path. Daimon doesn't even look — his coach does it for him.
- **Panel 4**: Yadi looks at the bracket. His eyes scan each name. Stops at "Daimon Richwell" at the top. Thinks:

> *"If I want to reach him... I have to win everything."*

---

### PAGE 11

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Exterior. Sunset. Players retiring to their rooms or to dinner. The club empties out.
- **Panel 2**: Yen and Yadi walking through the hallways. Yen:

> "Did you see the bracket?"

> "Yeah. Daimon's at the top."

> "Scared?"

- **Panel 3**: Yadi, after a moment:

> "Hungry."

- **Panel 4**: Yen smiles:

> "That's the right answer."

---

### PAGE 12

**4 panels — The Court at Night**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: The empty courts at night. Artificial lights on at a single court. The rest in darkness.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi alone on the lit court. Mama's new racket in hand. Papa's bandana on his forehead. Hitting balls.
- **Panel 3**: His shots sound different here — cleaner on this surface. It feels good. It feels right.
- **Panel 4**: A club employee spots him from afar. Murmurs to a colleague:

> "Who's that kid practicing alone at this hour?"

---

### PAGE 13

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi practicing his serve. One, two, three. Each one better than the last. The sound echoes in the empty club.
- **Panel 2**: He stops. Looks at the empty court in front of him. The perfect lines. The taut net. The lights. Imagines the stands full.
- **Panel 3 (large)**: Manga visualization: for an instant, Yadi sees himself on a center court, with thousands of people. In front of him, enormous shadows — the silhouettes of the great players. The image fades. Back to reality. Alone. Empty court.

---

### PAGE 14

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi closes his eyes on the court. Breathes. Uses what Yen taught him — calms the mind.
- **Panel 2**: Opens his eyes. Calm. Focused.
- **Panel 3**: Takes out his phone. Calls home. Mama answers before the second ring:

> "Son?! How are you?! Did you eat?! What are the courts like?!"

Yadi, laughing:

> "I'm fine, ma. The courts are incredible."

- **Panel 4**: Papa takes the phone:

> "Did you see the other players?"

> "Yeah."

> "Are they good?"

> "Yeah. But so am I."

Silence. Papa:

> "That's how you talk. Tiger."

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1 (large, panoramic)**: The empty court seen from above. Yadi standing in the center, alone, under the lights. Small but firm.
- **Panel 2**: Close-up of his face. Absolute determination. The bandana firm. Dark eyes but with that spark being born.
- **Panel 3 (final panel)**: Close-up of his eyes. Text:

> *"I didn't come here to participate. I came here to make them know who I am."*

**Closing text**:

> → Chapter 4: "First Blood"

## Artist Notes

- **Key visual transition**: From the vibrant tropical island (turquoise, green, palm trees, breeze) to the cold/bright club. The reader must FEEL the contrast.
- **The rival introduction page** (pg 6) must be iconic — shōnen manga character entrance style. Each one with their own visual energy.
- **The parents' note** in the tupperware is a small but crucial detail — the contrast between mama's handwriting (love) and papa's (competitive) in a single note defines the family.
- **Daimon**: Must look genuinely intimidating, not like a cartoon villain. He's arrogant because he really is good. His contempt is real.
- **The court at night**: Intimate moment. Yadi alone, with the lights. Must feel cinematic — like a painting.
- **Yadi invisible**: On the rival page, Yadi has no introduction text. He's in the background. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. The reader should feel what Yadi feels: being nobody.
