## ~15 pages | ACT 2: THE FIRE

---

## Summary

Yadi faces Luca Santori, the circuit's psychological manipulator. For the first time, Yadi doesn't lose due to lack of talent or strategy — he loses mental control. Luca destroys him from the inside in the first set. But with Yen's guidance, Yadi builds his "mental armor" — the shield that will protect him forever. A cold, lethal victory that marks a before and after.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Third day of the tournament. Yadi in the locker room preparing. Calmer than the first day. Puts on the bandana naturally — it's a ritual now.
- **Panel 2**: Yen enters. Sits across from him. Serious expression — more serious than usual.

> "Listen. Today is different."

- **Panel 3**: Yadi:

> "Luca Santori. I saw him play yesterday. He doesn't seem that strong."

- **Panel 4**: Yen, leaning forward:

> "He isn't. Technically he's the worst of the four you're going to face. But he's the most dangerous."

---

### PAGE 2

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi, confused:

> "How can he be the most dangerous if he's not the best?"

- **Panel 2**: Yen:

> "Because he doesn't play against your racket. He plays against your head. He's a viper. Everything he does — every gesture, every word, every pause — is designed to get inside your mind. If you give him a crack, he gets in. And once he's inside, he destroys you."

- **Panel 3**: Yadi processes. Thinks about everything he's learned about mental fortitude.

> "Then I don't give him a crack."

- **Panel 4**: Yen, standing up:

> "That sounds easy here. Out there it's different. Just remember: don't give him anything. Not a reaction. Not a look. Nothing."

---

### PAGE 3

**4 panels — Pre-Match: The Trap**

- **Panel 1**: Hallway before entering the court. Yadi walking. Suddenly, a friendly voice behind him:

> "Hey! Yadi, right?"

- **Panel 2**: Luca Santori. Wide smile. Hand extended. Friendly. Too friendly. Yadi shakes his hand out of politeness.
- **Panel 3**: Luca, casual, as if they were lifelong friends:

> "Great game yesterday against Kai. Impressive. Hey, they say Daimon is waiting for you in the zone final. Doesn't that make you nervous?"

- **Panel 4**: Close-up of Luca's eyes. The smile is perfect, but the eyes are cold. Calculating. He's planting seeds. Yadi doesn't consciously notice, but something feels off.

> Yadi: "Thanks. First I have to beat you."
> Luca, laughing: "Of course, of course! Just talking."

---

### PAGE 4

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi enters the court. Bigger crowd — the underdog story is attracting people. Yen in the stands, visible tension.
- **Panel 2**: Luca enters. Greets the crowd with a theatrical bow. Some laugh. Surface charm.
- **Panel 3**: Warm-up. Luca hits soft, casual, as if he doesn't care. But every ball goes exactly where he wants. Yadi notices the precision:

> Thought: *"He's more precise than I thought..."*

- **Panel 4**: They greet each other at the net before starting. Luca winks:

> "Let's have a good match, friend."

Yadi nods, uncomfortable without knowing why.

---

### PAGE 5

**5 panels — First Set: Psychological Domination**

- **Panel 1**: First game. Yadi serves. Quick point. 15-0. Yadi feels good.
- **Panel 2**: Second point. Long rally. Yadi wins. But Luca takes 15 extra seconds to position for the next serve. Ties his shoes. Wipes his face. Drinks water out of turn.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi waiting. The rhythm breaks. When he finally serves, the serve is worse. Luca hits a return winner.
- **Panel 4**: Luca celebrates the point with an exaggerated gesture — fist pump, shout, as if it were match point of a final. The crowd laughs.
- **Panel 5**: Yadi, thinking:

> *"What is he doing...?"*

---

### PAGE 6

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Luca's service game. Serves slow — deliberately slow. Yadi returns, rally, Yadi wins the point. But Luca makes a condescending gesture — claps for Yadi as if he were a child who did something cute:

> "Nice shot! Very good!"

- **Panel 2**: Yadi gets irritated. Not by the point — by the tone. It's as if Luca treats him as inferior even when losing.
- **Panel 3**: Next point. Yadi forces a shot out of anger — error. Luca smiles. Doesn't celebrate. Just smiles. The smile is worse than any shout.
- **Panel 4 (wide)**: Montage: Luca using every trick in the book — moves when Yadi serves (subtle distraction), takes maximum time at every changeover, makes quiet comments when passing the net that the umpire can't hear, celebrates every point like it's a Grand Crown final. Yadi falls apart piece by piece.

---

### PAGE 7

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Score: **Luca 5-3, first set.** Yadi isn't playing badly technically — he's making bad decisions because he's angry. Exactly Luca's plan.
- **Panel 2**: Changeover. Yadi in his chair. Grips the racket with rage. Thinks about Luca's words before the match: *"Daimon is waiting for you in the final..."* — the seed he planted is growing.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi thinks: *"What if Daimon destroys me? What if this guy is right? What if I don't belong here?"*
- **Panel 4**: **First set: Luca 6-4.** Luca walks to his chair like nothing happened, humming. Yadi stays seated, head down.

---

### PAGE 8

**3 large panels — The Collapse**

- **Panel 1 (top)**: Yadi on the edge. Second set starts badly — loses his serve. 0-1. Luca's provocations are more subtle now — he doesn't need to do much. Yadi is destroying himself.
- **Panel 2 (center)**: Yadi after another error, staring at the ground. Dark panel. The crowd noise fades. He only hears his own inner voice attacking him:

> *"You're not enough."*
> *"What are you doing here?"*
> *"Come beat me with that racket."*
> *"You're just an island kid."*

- **Panel 3 (bottom)**: In the stands, Yen watches. His jaw is tight. Knows Yadi is falling. Waits for the exact moment.

---

### PAGE 9

**3 large panels — THE INTERVENTION**

- **Panel 1**: Changeover. Yadi sitting, mentally defeated. Down 1-3 in the second set. If he loses this set, it's over.
- **Panel 2 (large, center)**: Yen leans on the stands railing. Calm voice, but every word weighs tons:

> "Yadi."

Yadi looks up.

> "He's playing with you, not against you. You decide if you give him power over your head."

Pause. Yen looks him directly in the eyes:

> "Who controls your mind? You or him?"

- **Panel 3 (bottom)**: Close-up of Yadi. The words hit him like an electric shock. *"Who controls your mind?"* — The most important question anyone has ever asked him.

---

### PAGE 10

**3 large panels — The Birth of the Armor**

- **Panel 1 (top)**: Yadi closes his eyes in the chair. Dark panel. Total silence.
- **Panel 2 (center — KEY PANEL OF THE CHAPTER)**: Manga visualization: in the darkness of his mind, an invisible armor forms around Yadi's body. It's not physical — it's mental. Crystal light pieces cover his chest, arms, head. Each piece has a word engraved:

> LET GO — ENJOY — FOCUS — ENDURE

The armor shines like a diamond. The darkness around him shatters like broken glass.

- **Panel 3 (bottom)**: Yadi opens his eyes. They're different. Not glowing like Diamond Vision — they're colder. More controlled. Emptier of unnecessary emotion. He stands from the chair.

> Thought: *"I control my mind."*

---

### PAGE 11

**5 panels — The Cold Transformation**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi walks to his position to receive serve. Luca notices something different — Yadi's posture has changed. He's no longer tense or frustrated. He's... nothing. Neutral. Unshakeable.
- **Panel 2**: Luca serves. Rally. Luca tries his trick — celebrates a normal shot exaggeratedly. Looks at Yadi seeking a reaction.
- **Panel 3**: Close-up of Yadi. Zero reaction. Not a raised eyebrow. Not a clenched fist. Nothing. The provocation bounces off like a ball against a wall.
- **Panel 4**: Luca, for the first time, frowns slightly. His weapon doesn't work.
- **Panel 5**: Yadi wins the point with a clean forehand. Doesn't celebrate. Doesn't look at Luca. Simply walks to his position. Cold. Lethal.

---

### PAGE 12

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Point montage: Yadi playing like a machine. No visible emotion. Every shot is precise, calculated, relentless. Luca tries more tricks — Yadi doesn't react to ANYTHING.
- **Panel 2**: Luca starts to crack. HIS emotions start betraying him. An unforced error. Then another. Slaps his racket against his leg.
- **Panel 3**: Score: **Yadi 5-3, second set.** The irony: Luca, the manipulator, is emotionally crumbling.
- **Panel 4**: The crowd notices. Murmurs:

> "The island kid isn't giving him anything."
> "It's like he's playing against a wall."
> "But the wall hits winners."

---

### PAGE 13

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: **Second set: Yadi 6-2.** Dominant victory. Yadi came back from 1-3 down to win 6-2. No celebration. Just control.
- **Panel 2**: Third set. Luca tries one last strategy — changes his game, comes to the net, varies. But he no longer has his main weapon. Without the mind games, Luca is a correct but not extraordinary player.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi dominates with intelligence and calm. 4-1 up. Every point is clean. Every game is one step closer to victory.
- **Panel 4**: Match point. 5-2. 40-30. Yadi preparing to serve.

---

### PAGE 14 — The Final Blow

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1 (top)**: Yadi looks at Luca across the net before serving. Not with hate. Not with rage. With NOTHING. It's the most terrifying look you can give — total indifference.
- **Panel 2 (center, large)**: Yadi tosses the ball. Perfect serve motion. **ACE.** Down the center. Luca doesn't move. The ball leaves a speed flash. **SFX: CRACK!!**
- **Panel 3 (bottom)**: Point. Set. Match. **Yadi wins: 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.** Luca smashes his racket on the ground. Furious. The smile mask has finally fallen. Underneath: a frustrated kid who only knows how to win one way and just lost his identity.

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi exits the court. Yen waits. Silence. Yen smiles genuinely — the first complete and real smile from Yen in the entire manga:

> "Now yes... now you're ready."

- **Panel 2**: Yadi looks at him. Touches his chest — can feel the armor still there. It's not something you put on and take off. It's part of him now.

> "I felt it, Yen. Like... a shield."

- **Panel 3**: Yen, nodding:

> "That's mental fortitude. And now that you have it, nobody takes it away."

- **Panel 4 (large, final panel)**: Yadi from behind, walking through the club hallway. In the background, the next match sign updates: **ZONE FINAL — Y. Vazq vs D. Richwell.** Yadi doesn't look at the sign. Doesn't need to. Already knows who's next.

> Thought: *"Daimon Richwell. I'm coming for you."*

**Closing text**:

> → Chapter 7: "The Golden Boy vs. The Island Diamond"

## Artist Notes

- **The mental armor** (pg 10) is THE most important visual moment of the chapter. Must be epic but INTERNAL — not an external power-up like Dragon Ball. It's a crystalline/diamond shield that forms INSIDE Yadi's mind. Translucent, geometric, like diamond facets.
- **Yadi's indifference** post-armor must be visually notable. Emptier eyes (not sad — controlled), relaxed but firm posture, economical movement.
- **Luca crumbling**: The visual inversion is key. At the start Luca smiles and Yadi suffers. At the end Yadi is ice and Luca explodes. Luca's smile should crack gradually panel by panel.
- **The final ace**: Must be clean, fast, no exaggeration. It's not a fantasy shot — it's cold precision. The beauty is in the lethal simplicity.
- **Contrast Ch 4 vs Ch 6**: In Ch 4, Yadi won by letting go and enjoying (positive emotional). In Ch 6, he wins by controlling and emptying (neutral emotional). Two different tools. Both necessary.
