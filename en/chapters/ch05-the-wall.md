## Summary

Yadi faces Kai Morimoto, the defensive player who returns absolutely everything. Yadi learns the hardest lesson yet: talent without strategy isn't enough. After losing a first set out of frustration, Yadi evolves his game and discovers new facets — variation, net play, tactical intelligence. A hard-fought victory that changes him as a player.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Morning of day two. Yadi on the warm-up court, hitting balls with confidence. Feels good after yesterday's victory.
- **Panel 2**: Yen approaches. His expression doesn't share Yadi's optimism. Serious:

> "We need to talk about your next rival."

- **Panel 3**: Yadi, still riding the energy of his win:

> "Kai Morimoto, right? The #3. I already saw him. He doesn't seem that intimidating."

- **Panel 4**: Yen, cutting the confidence at the root:

> "That kid doesn't have your talent. But he has something worse: infinite patience. He's a wall. Returns everything. Everything. And if you play his game, you lose."

---

### PAGE 2

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi, less confident now:

> "So what do I do?"

- **Panel 2**: Yen:

> "I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'll tell you what NOT to do: don't get frustrated. Don't force. Don't play faster than you need to. He wants you to get desperate. That's his weapon."

- **Panel 3**: Yadi nods. But in his eyes you can see he doesn't fully understand. Thinks his talent will be enough.
- **Panel 4 (wide)**: Sign on the court: **SECOND ROUND — Court 2 — Y. Vazq vs K. Morimoto**. Bigger crowd than yesterday — word of Yadi's comeback attracted the curious.

---

### PAGE 3

**4 panels — The Match Begins**

- **Panel 1**: Both on the court. Kai on the other side: short, stocky, completely expressionless. Doesn't look at Yadi. Doesn't look at anyone. Only looks at the ball.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi serves. Good serve. Kai returns it. No power, no style, but perfect placement. Comes back deep to the center.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi attacks. Cross-court forehand with angle. A shot that yesterday would be a winner...
- **Panel 4**: ...Kai is there. Returns it. No apparent effort. The ball comes back to Yadi like a mirror.

> Yadi thinks: *"How did he get there?"*

---

### PAGE 4

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi attacks again. Aggressive backhand down the line. On the line. Should be a winner.
- **Panel 2**: Kai. There. Again. Returns. The ball comes back deep.
- **Panel 3**: Rally. 10 shots. 15. 20. Yadi hits harder each time. Kai returns everything. No emotion. No tiring. Like a robot.
- **Panel 4**: Yadi forces a shot — too hard, too much angle. The ball goes out by centimeters. Unforced error.
- **Panel 5**: Kai doesn't celebrate. Doesn't react. Just walks to his position for the next point. The coldness is terrifying.

### PAGE 5

**4 panels — Frustration Grows**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Point montage: Yadi attacking with everything — powerful forehands, cross-court backhands, drop shots. Every shot looks like a winner...
- **Panel 2**: ...and Kai returns ALL of them. Repetitive visual panel: 4 identical mini-panels of Kai sliding, returning, expressionless. Over and over and over. The visual effect must be suffocating — like a wall that never breaks.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi starting to get frustrated. Shouts after an error. Slaps the racket against his leg.
- **Panel 4**: Score: **Kai 5-3, first set**. Yadi is forcing everything. His shots are more powerful but less intelligent. Exactly what Kai wants.

---

### PAGE 6

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi tries a drop shot. Kai sees it coming — runs and gets there. Returns with a perfect lob over Yadi's head. Kai's point.
- **Panel 2**: **First set: Kai 7-5.** Yadi lost while hitting more winners than Kai, but making triple the errors. Yen was right.
- **Panel 3**: Changeover. Yadi in the chair, towel on face. Breathing heavy. Not from tiredness — from frustration. Thinks:

> *"I'm hitting harder than anyone and it doesn't work. What do I do? What do I do?"*

- **Panel 4**: Looks at Yen in the stands. Desperate. Searching for an answer.

---

### PAGE 7

**3 large panels — THE LESSON**

- **Panel 1 (top)**: Yen in the stands. Stands up. Doesn't shout — speaks loud, clear, direct. The whole crowd hears:

> "Stop fighting him! Fight yourself!"

- **Panel 2 (center)**: Close-up of Yadi. The words hit him. *"Fight yourself."* He suddenly understands — he's not losing to Kai. He's losing to his own desperation. Kai only returns what Yadi gives him. The problem is Yadi.
- **Panel 3 (bottom, large)**: Yadi closes his eyes. Dark panel. Only his silhouette visible. In the black, Yen's teachings appear as floating text:

> *"One ball at a time."*
> *"Don't think about winning."*
> *"You need a plan, not just talent."*

Yadi opens his eyes. Different. Calmer. More dangerous.

### PAGE 8

**4 panels — The Strategy Change**

- **Panel 1**: Second set. Yadi serves. But different — not with max power. With placement. The ball goes to the T, with slice. Kai returns it, but the angle leaves him slightly out of position.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi doesn't attack the open space. Instead, plays deep to the center. Waits. Kai returns. Yadi plays deep again. Now HE'S the one with patience.
- **Panel 3**: After 8 shots, Yadi sees the opening — Kai is half a step to the left. Yadi changes direction: down the line to the empty side. Kai doesn't reach it.
- **Panel 4**: First winner from Yadi that wasn't forced — it was constructed. Thought out. Strategic. Yadi pumps his fist. But doesn't shout. Control.

> Yen in the stands, thinking: *"He's learning in real time."*

---

### PAGE 9

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi comes to the net for the first time in his competitive life. Volley. Short point. Kai didn't expect that.
- **Panel 2**: Next point: Yadi varies — slice, topspin, flat, drop shot, lob. Mixes rhythms. Changes heights. He's no longer a cannon — he's a chef mixing ingredients.
- **Panel 3**: Kai for the first time shows something: a wrinkle on his forehead. Minimal. Almost invisible. But it's there. The crack in the wall.
- **Panel 4**: Score: **Yadi 4-2, second set.** Momentum has shifted.
- **Panel 5**: The crowd starts getting hooked. Positive murmurs:

> "The kid completely changed his game."
> "Who taught him to do that?"

---

### PAGE 10

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi serving for the set. Serve + approach to the net. Kai hits a passing shot... Yadi intercepts with a backhand volley. Point.
- **Panel 2**: **Second set: Yadi 6-3.** Yadi doesn't celebrate excessively. Nods. Controls the emotion. He's in strategic mode.
- **Panel 3**: Kai in his chair during the changeover. For the first time, drinks water slower than normal. His gaze is no longer completely empty — there's something new. Concern? Respect?
- **Panel 4**: Yen in the stands. A smile he's trying to contain:

> Thought: *"He's not just playing better. He's thinking better. He's growing right now, before my eyes."*

---

### PAGE 11

**4 panels — Third Set: The Battle**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Third set. Kai raises his level. Moves faster, returns with more depth. The wall has been reinforced. It won't fall easy.
- **Panel 2**: Epic rally. 25 shots. Both running, both smart. Yadi mixes, Kai returns. Yadi comes forward, Kai lobs. Yadi runs back, returns with a smash. Kai gets there. The rally seems infinite.
- **Panel 3**: Finally, Yadi hits a drop shot after 30 shots. Kai runs, gets there, barely touches the ball... and sends it into the net. Yadi's point. The crowd applauds.
- **Panel 4**: Score: **4-3 Yadi.** Both at their limit. But Yadi has something Kai doesn't: he's enjoying himself.

---

### PAGE 12

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Crucial game. 5-4 Yadi. Kai serving to stay in the match. Serve, rally, Kai's point. 15-0.
- **Panel 2**: Another rally. Yadi is patient, constructs, finds the angle — winner. 15-15.
- **Panel 3**: Long point. 20 shots. Kai makes a forced error caused by Yadi — the ball goes out by millimeters. 15-30.
- **Panel 4**: Kai for the first time clenches his fists. Not in celebration — in pressure. The wall has emotions after all.

---

### PAGE 13

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: Match point for Yadi. 30-40. Kai serves. Yadi returns deep. 12-shot rally.
- **Panel 2 (large, center)**: Yadi sees the opening — eyes flash for an instant, trajectory lines visible for half a second. The Diamond Vision. Forehand down the line, powerful, to the corner.
- **Panel 3 (large)**: The ball hits the line. **IN.** The judge signals. Point. Set. Match. **Yadi wins: 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.** Hard-fought, grueling, intelligent victory.

---

### PAGE 14

**4 panels — The Respect**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi and Kai at the net. Handshake. The grip lasts longer than normal.
- **Panel 2**: Kai, looking Yadi in the eyes for the first time with a real expression. Low voice, almost a whisper:

> "We'll play again."

- **Panel 3**: Yadi, nodding:

> "I hope so."

- **Panel 4**: Kai walks away. Turns back one last time. The slightest bow of the head — Japanese respect. Then disappears into the tunnel.

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi sitting in the locker room. Exhausted — physically and mentally. But there's something new on his face. Satisfaction. Not from winning, but from having learned something.
- **Panel 2**: Yen at the locker room door:

> "Today you didn't win with talent."

Yadi looks at him.

> "Today you won with your head. That's more important."

- **Panel 3 (large, final panel)**: Yadi leans back on the bench. Looks at the ceiling. Smiles. Thinks:

> *"There's more than one way to win a match."*

In the corner of the panel, a glimpse of the tournament bracket: next rival — **Luca Santori.**

**Closing text**:

> → Chapter 6: "Venom"

## Artist Notes

- **The visual wall**: Kai's returning panels must be INTENTIONALLY REPETITIVE. 4-5 identical mini-panels of Kai sliding and returning. The reader must feel the claustrophobia of playing against someone like this.
- **First set vs Second set**: The change isn't emotional this time (like Ch 4) but STRATEGIC. Yadi's shots in the second set should look more visually varied — different angles, heights, rhythms.
- **Kai**: Minimal expression. The micro-changes in his face (the wrinkle, the clenched fist) must be SUBTLE. The attentive reader notices them. He's a character who says more with what he doesn't say.
- **Coming to the net**: Visually distinct moment — Yadi in the foreground, close to the net, different perspective. Shows he's literally in new territory.
- **The final respect**: Kai's bow must be powerful in its minimalism. No long words. Just a head nod and "We'll play again." That's it, and it's enough.
