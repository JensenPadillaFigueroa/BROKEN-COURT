## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### PAGE 1

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1 (wide)**: Next day. Public courts at the Municipal Sports Center. Morning. Yadi arrives as always, plastic bag, old racket.
- **Panel 2**: He stops. On the court where they played yesterday, Yen is already there. Sitting on the bench, towel on shoulder, waiting. As if he knew Yadi would come.
- **Panel 3**: Yadi, surprised:

> "Were you waiting for me?"

- **Panel 4**: Yen, casual, not looking at him:

> "Don't flatter yourself. I come every day."

Pause. Then:

> "But yeah. I was waiting for you. Let's play."

---

### PAGE 2

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1**: They play. Yen wins the first point easily.
- **Panel 2**: Second point. Yen varies — this time tests Yadi with a drop shot. Yadi runs but doesn't make it.
- **Panel 3**: Third point. Yen moves him side to side. Yadi runs everything but his shots are desperate.
- **Panel 4**: After 20 minutes, the score is demolishing. Yadi leaning on his knees, sweating, exhausted.
- **Panel 5**: Yen isn't even sweating. Approaches the net:

> "Do you want me to be honest with you?"

Yadi looks at him, breathing heavy:

> "Yes."

### PAGE 3

**3 large panels — THE FIRST TRUTH**

- **Panel 1 (top)**: Yen and Yadi sitting on the bench at the edge of the court. Water bottles. Silence for a moment.
- **Panel 2 (center, close-up of Yen)**: Yen looking straight ahead, direct:

> "You have something I never had. Something that can't be trained. I saw it yesterday — that shot, that angle... that can't be taught."

- **Panel 3 (bottom, large panel)**: Yen turns to look Yadi directly in the eyes. No softening:

> "But right now you're a bomb without a detonator. All that talent... and your head sabotages you every 5 minutes. You get frustrated, you lose focus, you worry about things you can't control. If you don't fix that, you're going to be another kid with potential who never amounted to anything."

---

### PAGE 4

**5 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi clenches his fists. Eyes wet — not from sadness, from frustration. It hurts because he knows it's true.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi, voice trembling:

> "And what do you know? You don't know me."

- **Panel 3**: Yen, unfazed:

> "I know you carry a racket held together with tape and sneakers with the sole falling off. I know you come from an island where nobody plays tennis. And I know that yesterday you hit a shot that I, with 7 years of formal training, can't hit."

- **Panel 4**: Silence. Yadi looks at him.
- **Panel 5**: Yen:

> "Train with me. I'm not going to teach you how to hit the ball — you already know that. I'm going to teach you how to use your head."

---

### PAGE 5

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi, after a moment:

> "Why would you help me?"

- **Panel 2**: Yen stands up, puts the towel on his shoulder. Looks at the court:

> "Because I have the mind but not your talent. You have the talent but not the mind. Between the two of us, we could make one complete player."

- **Panel 3 (large, bottom)**: Yen extends his hand to Yadi. Yadi looks at it. Takes it. Firm handshake.

> **Narration (Yadi)**: *"I didn't know that handshake was going to change my life."*

---

### PAGES 6-7 — DOUBLE PAGE: Training Montage

**Dynamic montage — multiple small and medium panels, manga training style. Weeks compressed.**

**Panel A**: Yen blindfolds Yadi. Throws balls at him. Yadi must listen to the ball and react.

> Yen: "Tennis isn't just what you see. It's what you feel."

**Panel B**: Yadi meditating on the court. Eyes closed. Yen timing him. Yadi fidgets.

> Yen: "3 minutes without thinking about anything. Can you?"
> Yadi: "...No."
> Yen: "Again."

**Panel C**: Yen blasts music from an old speaker while they play. Reggaetón, rock, noise. Yadi can't concentrate, misses everything.

> Yen: "If you can't play with noise, you can't play in a stadium."

**Panel D**: Yadi running at dawn. Alone. The island streets still dark, palm trees like shadows against the sky. Papa Rodríguez watches him leave from the window. Nods silently.

**Panel E**: Yen and Yadi playing in the rain. Yadi slips. Gets up. Keeps going.

**Panel F**: Yen being brutal after a bad training session:

> "You're worrying again. See that ball? That ball doesn't know you're poor. Doesn't know you're scared. It only knows where you send it."

**Panel G**: Yadi hitting against the wall with Luna Borín's mural at night, on the island court. Alone. Determined. The mark on the wall is getting deeper and deeper.

**Panel H (large, center of the double page)**: Close-up of Yadi's eyes during a training rally — more focused, calmer. The flash in his eyes appears again, this time a bit more visible.

**Panel I**: Mama Rodríguez watching Yadi come home exhausted every night. Prepares food with a worried face but smiling:

> "Son, is that Yen training you or torturing you?"

**Panel J**: Papa Rodríguez at the end of the table, serious:

> "He's getting better. You can tell."

### PAGE 8

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Weeks later. Public court. Yadi and Yen playing. But something is different — Yadi moves with more fluidity, more looseness.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi smiles on the court. For the first time, he's having FUN during a match with Yen. Not frustrated, not tense.
- **Panel 3**: The flash in his eyes appears more often — brief flashes during rallies. Yen notices but says nothing.
- **Panel 4**: Yen, back to camera, looking at Yadi across the net. A subtle smile that Yadi doesn't see.

> Yen's thought: *"He's changing... faster than I expected."*

---

### PAGE 9

**4 panels — Connection moment**

- **Panel 1**: After a training session. Sitting in the Sports Center stands, sharing water.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi:

> "Hey, Yen... why did you stop competing?"

- **Panel 3**: Yen looks at his knee. The scar. Long silence.

> "My knee decided for me. But my head had already given up before that."

- **Panel 4**: Yen looks at Yadi:

> "That's why I tell you to fix the head first. Because the body can fail you, but if your mind is strong... you always find a way."

---

### PAGE 10

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi, processing:

> "Do you regret it?"

- **Panel 2**: Yen, honest:

> "Every day."

Pause.

> "But if I can make sure you don't have to regret anything... maybe that's worth something."

- **Panel 3**: Silence. Yadi looks at the sky. Yen looks at the ground. Two people who need each other without saying it.
- **Panel 4 (bottom, wide)**: Panoramic of both sitting in the empty stands. Small in the frame. But together.

---

### PAGE 11

**4 panels — Weeks later**

- **Panel 1**: Court. Practice match. Yadi vs Yen. First set: Yen wins but it cost him. 6-4.
- **Panel 2**: Second set: long rally. 15 shots, 20. Both running. But Yadi reads the game, anticipates, and hits a cross-court winner. The point is his.
- **Panel 3**: Yen serving. Yadi returns with power. Yen doesn't reach it. Break.
- **Panel 4**: Score on the court screen (if there is one) or simply text: **Second set: Yadi 6-3**. Going to a third.

---

### PAGE 12

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Third set. Crucial point. Yadi serves. Clean serve, with direction. Ace. His eyes flash for an instant.
- **Panel 2**: Final rally of the match. 30 shots. Both at their limit. But Yadi is mentally fresher — Yen gets frustrated first.
- **Panel 3 (large)**: Yadi hits a perfect drop shot. Yen runs, doesn't make it. The ball bounces twice. **Match point. Yadi wins.**
- **Panel 4**: Silence on the court. Both look at each other across the net.

---

### PAGE 13

**3 large panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yadi at the net. Doesn't celebrate excessively. Doesn't shout. Looks at Yen with deep respect. Extends his hand.
- **Panel 2**: Yen takes it. Handshake. Yen nods:

> "About time, idiot."

- **Panel 3 (large, bottom)**: Both smile. A moment of real camaraderie. Not student-teacher — it's something more. Yen ruffles Yadi's hair. Yadi laughs.

> **Narration (Yadi)**: *"I surpassed him on the court. But I'll never stop looking up to him."*

---

### PAGE 14

**4 panels**

- **Panel 1**: Yen sits on the bench. Takes something from his bag — a folded flyer.
- **Panel 2**: Opens it and shows it to Yadi. Close-up of the flyer: **"NATIONAL JUNIOR TOURNAMENT — OPEN REGISTRATION"**. Perfect courts in the image. Sponsor logos. Everything looks big, distant, impossible.
- **Panel 3**: Yen:

> "It's time for the world to see what I saw."

- **Panel 4**: Yadi takes the flyer. His hands tremble. His eyes widen. It's the first time he's seen something like this up close — a real opportunity.

---

### PAGE 15 — Closing

**3 panels**

- **Panel 1 (large)**: Yadi looking at the flyer. Close-up of his eyes reflecting the images of professional courts, trophies, players.
- **Panel 2**: Yadi, voice low but firm:

> "Do you think I'm ready?"

- **Panel 3 (final panel, large)**: Yen, standing, towel on shoulder, looking at the horizon. Defiant smile:

> "No. But you're going anyway."

**Closing text**:

> → Chapter 3: "The World Out There"

## Artist Notes

- **Visual tone**: More intimate than Ch 1. Many face-to-face conversation panels.
- **The training montage** (pgs 6-7) must be DYNAMIC — this is the moment to show visual variety: rain, night, blindfolded, music, sweat, effort.
- **Yen**: His expression goes from indifferent (beginning) to genuinely connected (end). Subtle transition panel by panel.
- **Yadi**: His posture changes throughout the chapter — from hunched and insecure to more upright and loose.
- **Yen's knee scene**: Moment of vulnerability. Dimmer lighting, tighter panels.
- **The match where Yadi wins**: Don't make it visually epic (that comes later). Make it intimate — two people who know each other well, competing with respect.
- **The flyer**: Should look ENORMOUS in Yadi's hands — contrast between the glossy paper of the flyer and his blistered hands.
