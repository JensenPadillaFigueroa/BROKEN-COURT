# PARTE 1: DISEÑOS DE PERSONAJES (Character Sheets)

## CONCEPTO VISUAL: HÍBRIDOS vs AURAS

**REGLA FUNDAMENTAL**: Solo los **Great 3** (Novacronos, Rafa Nal, Noak) son **HÍBRIDOS LITERALES** — tienen cabeza de animal sobre cuerpo humano. Son las únicas figuras que trascienden lo humano visualmente. Son DIOSES del tenis. Su diseño refleja eso.

**Todos los demás personajes son 100% HUMANOS.** Su asociación animal se expresa SOLO como:
- Sombras/siluetas de fondo durante momentos intensos
- Auras de energía translúcidas
- Metáforas visuales sutiles (postura, movimiento, ojos)
- NUNCA rasgos físicos de animal en su cuerpo

| Tipo | Personajes | Cómo se ve |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **HÍBRIDO LITERAL** (cabeza de animal) | Novacronos (águila), Rafa Nal (toro), Noak (cabra) | Cabeza de animal real sobre cuerpo humano atlético. Siempre. No son humanos que se transforman — SON así. |
| **HUMANO + AURA** (solo metáfora visual) | Yadi, Yen, Charlie, Jani, Daimon, Kai, Luca, Luna Borín, etc. | Personas normales. En momentos clave, una sombra/aura animal aparece DETRÁS o ALREDEDOR, nunca EN ellos. |
